4106	Another useless recycling of a brutal mid - '70s American sports movie .	neg
4107	Please , someone , stop Eric Schaeffer before he makes another film .	neg
4108	Most of the problems with the film do n't derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved	neg

4136	The characters are never more than sketches ... which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach .	neg

4184	Despite engaging offbeat touches , Knockaround Guys rarely seems interested in kicking around a raison d'etre that 's as fresh-faced as its young-guns cast .	neg
4186	The most offensive thing about the movie is that Hollywood expects people to pay to see it .	neg
4187	The movie is a mess from start to finish .	neg
4188	The trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness .	neg
4191	The plot is nothing but boilerplate clichés from start to finish , and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it 's also too stupid to realize that they 've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times	neg
4192	Terminally brain dead production .	neg
4193	Some episodes work , some do n't .	neg
4194	Beautifully filmed and well acted ... but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics .	pos
4195	J. Lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : She 's a pretty woman , but she 's no working girl .	pos
4196	Rymer does n't trust laughs -- and does n't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects .	neg
4197	Not only are the film 's Sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this ` we 're - doing-it-for - the-cash ' sequel were .	neg
4198	Wow .	pos
4199	I have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time .	neg
4200	Off the Hook is overlong and not well-acted , but credit writer-producer-director Adam Watstein with finishing it at all .	neg
4201	It 's a drag how Nettelbeck sees working women -- or at least this working woman -- for whom she shows little understanding .	neg
4203	It 's also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed Antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget .	neg

4213	An erotic thriller that 's neither too erotic nor very thrilling , either .	neg

4637	Unfortunately , Carvey 's rubber-face routine is no match for the insipid script he has crafted with Harris Goldberg .	neg
4639	There 's something unintentionally comic in the film 's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties .	neg
4641	And for all the wrong reasons besides .	neg
4642	A zippy 96 minutes of mediocre special effects , hoary dialogue , fluxing accents , and -- worst of all -- silly-looking Morlocks .	neg

4676	It 's such a mechanical endeavor ( that ) it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it .	neg
4677	The art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual DVD release will offer subtitles and the original Italian-language soundtrack .	pos
4678	If the predictability of bland comfort food appeals to you , then the film is a pleasant enough dish .	neg
4679	Ultimately , in the history of the Academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about `` Chicago '' in 2002 .	neg

4692	( Sam 's ) self-flagellation is more depressing than entertaining .	neg
4693	An ugly , pointless , stupid movie .	neg

4695	The Master of Disguise represents Adam Sandler 's latest attempt to dumb down the universe .	neg
4696	This is an ungainly movie , ill-fitting , with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be .	neg

4703	This mess of a movie is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy .	neg
4704	It 's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long .	neg
4705	A fifty car pileup of cliches .	neg
4706	It 's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish .	neg
4707	Not only is entry number twenty the worst of the Brosnan bunch , it 's one of the worst of the entire franchise .	neg
4708	What ultimately makes Windtalkers a disappointment is the superficial way it deals with its story .	neg
4709	As an actor 's showcase , Hart 's War has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed Willis is not the most impressive player .	pos
4710	As a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by Billy Ray and Terry George leaves something to be desired .	neg
4711	A non-Britney person might survive a screening with little harm done , except maybe for the last 15 minutes , which are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine .	neg
4713	It 's simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply , truly , bottomlessly cynical .	neg
4715	The drama was so uninspiring that even a story immersed in love , lust , and sin could n't keep my attention .	neg
4716	A rather tired exercise in nostalgia .	neg
4717	The misery of these people becomes just another voyeuristic spectacle , to be consumed and forgotten .	neg
4718	Some Body often looks like an episode of the TV show Blind Date , only less technically proficient and without the pop-up comments .	neg
4719	Bad Company has one of the most moronic screenplays of the year , full of holes that will be obvious even to those who are n't looking for them .	neg
4720	Predecessors The Mummy and The Mummy Returns stand as intellectual masterpieces next to The Scorpion King .	neg
4721	A markedly inactive film , City is conversational bordering on confessional .	neg

4724	We 've liked Klein 's other work but Rollerball left us cold .	neg
4725	They were afraid to show this movie to reviewers before its opening , afraid of the bad reviews they thought they 'd earn .	neg
4727	It would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in Dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction .	neg
4728	Offers no new insight on the matter , nor do its characters exactly spring to life .	neg
4729	Nohe has made a decent ` intro ' documentary , but he feels like a spectator and not a participant .	neg
4730	Apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret , but the only thing you 'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it .	neg
4731	A 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writer-director Parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit 's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum .	neg
4732	Guy gets girl , guy loses girl , audience falls asleep .	neg
4735	The weird thing about The Santa Clause 2 , purportedly a children 's movie , is that there is nothing in it to engage children emotionally .	neg
4736	It 's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish .	neg
4737	Contains the humor , characterization , poignancy , and intelligence of a bad sitcom .	neg
4738	It does n't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes .	pos
4739	It still feels like a prison stretch .	neg
4740	Partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless .	neg
4742	The overall feel is not unlike watching a glorified episode of `` 7th Heaven . ''	neg
4743	Just a Kiss is a just a waste .	neg
4744	... this is n't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism ; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels .	neg
4745	Frankly , it 's kind of insulting , both to men and women .	neg
4746	And it 's not that funny -- which is just generally insulting .	neg
4747	As if Drop Dead Gorgeous was n't enough , this equally derisive clunker is fixated on the spectacle of small-town competition .	neg
4748	A wretched movie that reduces the Second World War to one man 's quest to find an old flame .	neg
4749	This is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which Wilson and Murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie .	neg
4751	There 's a reason why halftime is only fifteen minutes long .	neg
4754	One of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart .	neg
4755	No better or worse than ` Truth or Consequences , N.M. ' or any other interchangeable actioner with imbecilic Mafia toolbags botching a routine assignment in a Western backwater .	neg

4757	I can imagine this movie as a b & w British comedy , circa 1960 , with Peter Sellers , Kenneth Williams , et al. , but at this time , with this cast , this movie is hopeless .	neg
4758	Talky , artificial and opaque ... an interesting technical exercise , but a tedious picture .	neg
4761	And in a sense , that 's a liability .	neg
4762	It 's easy to love Robin Tunney -- she 's pretty and she can act -- but it gets harder and harder to understand her choices .	neg

4771	Seagal ran out of movies years ago , and this is just the proof .	neg
4772	The movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it .	neg
4773	An awkwardly garish showcase that diverges from anything remotely probing or penetrating .	neg
4775	Jackass is a vulgar and cheap-looking version of Candid Camera staged for the Marquis de Sade set .	neg
4776	Children , Christian or otherwise , deserve to hear the full story of Jonah 's despair -- in all its agonizing , Catch-22 glory -- even if they spend years trying to comprehend it .	pos
4777	Pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle .	neg
4778	... the kind of movie you see because the theater has air conditioning .	neg

4780	Just another generic drama that has nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap thrills .	neg
4781	Hip-hop prison thriller of stupefying absurdity .	neg
4782	An uneven mix of dark satire and childhood awakening .	neg
4785	The film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based ` drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves Blue Crush waterlogged .	neg
4786	The problem is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage .	neg
4787	The images lack contrast , are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable .	neg
4788	Like a soft drink that 's been sitting open too long : it 's too much syrup and not enough fizz .	neg
4789	As the movie dragged on , I thought I heard a mysterious voice , and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light -- the light of the exit sign .	neg
4790	I have returned from the beyond to warn you : this movie is 90 minutes long , and life is too short .	neg
4791	There are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer .	neg
4793	In the end , The Weight of Water comes to resemble the kind of soft-core twaddle you 'd expect to see on Showtime 's ` Red Shoe Diaries . '	neg
4794	A straight-ahead thriller that never rises above superficiality .	neg
4795	Glizty but formulaic and silly ... Cagney 's ` top of the world ' has been replaced by the bottom of the barrel .	neg
4796	The re - enactments , however fascinating they may be as history , are too crude to serve the work especially well .	neg
4797	Is anyone else out there getting tired of the whole slo-mo , double-pistoled , ballistic-pyrotechnic Hong Kong action aesthetic ?	neg
4798	Once again , director Chris Columbus takes a hat-in-hand approach to Rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours .	neg
4799	Serving Sara is little more than a mall movie designed to kill time .	neg
4800	Too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to like , this could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot .	neg
4802	The most repugnant adaptation of a classic text since Roland Joffé and Demi Moore 's The Scarlet Letter .	neg

4807	The Adventures of Pluto Nash is a whole lot of nada .	neg

4813	I never thought I 'd say this , but I 'd much rather watch teens poking their genitals into fruit pies !	neg
4814	A film neither bitter nor sweet , neither romantic nor comedic , neither warm nor fuzzy .	pos
4815	Tiresomely derivative and hammily acted .	neg
4816	We never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they 'll wind up together , and Michele 's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest .	neg
4817	The plot grows thin soon , and you find yourself praying for a quick resolution .	neg
4818	Too bad Maggio could n't come up with a better script .	neg
4819	Much of the cast is stiff or just plain bad .	neg
4820	Rice is too pedestrian a filmmaker to bring any edge or personality to The Rising Place that would set it apart from other Deep South stories .	neg
4821	At best , Cletis Tout might inspire a trip to the video store -- in search of a better movie experience .	neg
4822	Witless , pointless , tasteless and idiotic .	neg
4823	Not really a thriller so much as a movie for teens to laugh , groan and hiss at .	neg
4824	As plain and pedestrian as catsup --	neg
4825	An improvement on the feeble examples of big-screen Poke-mania that have preceded it .	pos
4829	Whatever satire Lucky Break was aiming for , it certainly got lost in the `` soon-to-be-forgettable '' section of the quirky rip-off prison romp pile .	neg

4831	The package in which this fascinating -- and timely -- content comes wrapped is disappointingly generic .	neg
4832	Guys say mean things and shoot a lot of bullets .	neg
4833	Some of the characters die and others do n't , and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson , and , really , nobody in the viewing audience cares .	neg
4834	Wildly incompetent but brilliantly named Half Past Dead -- or for Seagal pessimists : Totally Past His Prime .	neg
4835	Just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence ... lacking the slightest bit of wit or charm .	neg
4836	All the movie 's narrative gymnastics ca n't disguise the fact that it 's inauthentic at its core and that its story just is n't worth telling .	neg
4837	Much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle , there is n't much there here .	neg
4838	The film ultimately offers nothing more than people in an urban jungle needing other people to survive ...	neg
4839	For all its shoot-outs , fistfights , and car chases , this movie is a phlegmatic bore , so tedious it makes the silly spy vs. spy film The Sum of All Fears , starring Ben Affleck , seem downright Hitchcockian .	neg
4840	This mild-mannered farce , directed by one of its writers , John C. Walsh , is corny in a way that bespeaks an expiration date passed a long time ago .	neg

4850	Crudup 's screen presence is the one thing that holds interest in the midst of a mushy , existential exploration of why men leave their families .	pos
4852	Despite terrific special effects and funnier gags , Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets finds a way to make J.K. Rowling 's marvelous series into a deadly bore .	neg

4854	The only thing I laughed at were the people who paid to see it .	neg
4855	All of the elements are in place for a great film noir , but director George Hickenlooper 's approach to the material is too upbeat .	neg
4856	The hackneyed story about an affluent damsel in distress who decides to fight her bully of a husband is simply too overdone .	neg
4858	Then you get another phone call warning you that if the video is n't back at Blockbuster before midnight , you 're going to face frightening late fees .	neg

4871	90 punitive minutes of eardrum-dicing gunplay , screeching-metal smashups , and flaccid odd-couple sniping .	neg
4872	Sadly , though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear , they ca n't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction .	neg

4916	A soulless jumble of ineptly assembled cliches and pabulum that plays like a 95-minute commercial for NBA properties .	neg
4917	Borstal Boy represents the worst kind of filmmaking , the kind that pretends to be passionate and truthful but is really frustratingly timid and soggy .	neg
4918	The film 's lack of personality permeates all its aspects -- from the TV movie-esque , affected child acting to the dullest Irish pub scenes ever filmed .	neg
4919	works on the whodunit level as its larger themes get lost in the murk of its own making	neg
4920	Crush could be the worst film a man has made about women since Valley of the Dolls .	neg
4921	4Ever has the same sledgehammer appeal as Pokemon videos , but it breathes more on the big screen and induces headaches more slowly .	pos

4940	Supposedly , Pokemon ca n't be killed , but Pokemon 4Ever practically assures that the pocket monster movie franchise is nearly ready to keel over .	neg
4941	White has n't developed characters so much as caricatures , one-dimensional buffoons that get him a few laughs but nothing else .	neg
4944	The film feels formulaic , its plot and pacing typical Hollywood war-movie stuff , while the performances elicit more of a sense of deja vu than awe .	neg
4945	This overproduced piece of dreck is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary .	neg
4946	Hmmm ... might I suggest that the wayward wooden one end it all by stuffing himself into an electric pencil sharpener ?	neg
4947	The makers of Mothman Prophecies succeed in producing that most frightening of all movies -- a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad .	neg

4954	A mean-spirited film made by someone who surely read The Catcher in the Rye but clearly suffers from dyslexia	neg

4960	Dogtown is hollow , self-indulgent , and - worst of all - boring .	neg
4961	A movie so bad that it quickly enters the pantheon of wreckage that includes Battlefield Earth and Showgirls .	neg
4963	It 's just too bad the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer , squad car pile-ups and the requisite screaming captain .	neg
4965	To be influenced chiefly by humanity 's greatest shame , reality shows -- reality shows for God 's sake !	neg

4980	My precious new Star Wars movie is a lumbering , wheezy drag ...	neg
4982	Too campy to work as straight drama and too violent and sordid to function as comedy , Vulgar is , truly and thankfully , a one-of-a-kind work .	neg
4983	Horrid little propaganda film with fascinating connections not only to the Serbs themselves but also to a network of American right-wing extremists .	pos

4985	It looks like an action movie , but it 's so poorly made , on all levels , that it does n't even qualify as a spoof of such .	neg
4986	It is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middle-age and older men drink to excess , piss on trees , b.s. one another and put on a show in drag .	neg
4987	Consider the film a celluloid litmus test for the intellectual and emotional pedigree of your date and a giant step backward for a director I admire .	neg

4992	Snow Dogs finds its humour in a black man getting humiliated by a pack of dogs who are smarter than him	neg
4993	Whole stretches of the film may be incomprehensible to moviegoers not already clad in basic black .	neg

5006	Feels at times like a giant commercial for Universal Studios , where much of the action takes place .	neg
5008	Britney Spears ' phoniness is nothing compared to the movie 's contrived , lame screenplay and listless direction .	neg
5009	Every sequel you skip will be two hours gained .	neg

5014	Twenty-three movies into a mostly magnificent directorial career , Clint Eastwood 's efficiently minimalist style finally has failed him .	neg

5026	There 's a delightfully quirky movie to be made from curling , but Brooms is n't it .	neg
5027	The story suffers a severe case of oversimplification , superficiality and silliness .	neg
5028	Chamber of Secrets will find millions of eager fans .	pos

5030	Too clever by about nine-tenths .	pos
5031	Has all the hallmarks of a movie designed strictly for children 's home video , a market so insatiable it absorbs all manner of lame entertainment , as long as 3-year-olds find it diverting .	neg
5032	Bears about as much resemblance to the experiences of most battered women as Spider-Man does to the experiences of most teenagers .	neg
5033	Toward the end Sum of All Fears morphs into a mundane '70s disaster flick .	neg
5034	Director Carl Franklin , so crisp and economical in One False Move , bogs down in genre cliches here .	pos

5037	This thing is just garbage .	neg
5039	There must be an audience that enjoys the Friday series , but I would n't be interested in knowing any of them personally .	neg
5040	A bold ( and lovely ) experiment that will almost certainly bore most audiences into their own brightly colored dreams .	pos
5042	An empty exercise , a florid but ultimately vapid crime melodrama with lots of surface flash but little emotional resonance .	neg
5043	If you are curious to see the darker side of what 's going on with young TV actors ( Dawson Leery did what ?!? ) , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there 's nothing very attractive about this movie .	neg
5044	My own minority report is that it stinks .	neg
5045	Trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie Snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- and the pay-off is negligible .	neg
5046	The script is high on squaddie banter , low on shocks .	pos
5047	... if you , like me , think an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with , then you 're in for a painful ride .	neg
5048	While Solondz tries and tries hard , Storytelling fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket .	neg
5049	With very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like Swimming With Sharks and The Player , this latest skewering ... may put off insiders and outsiders alike .	neg
5050	( Davis ) wants to cause his audience an epiphany , yet he refuses to give us real situations and characters .	neg
5051	Without a fresh infusion of creativity , 4Ever is neither a promise nor a threat so much as wishful thinking .	neg
5052	... unlike ( Scorsese 's Mean Streets ) , Ash Wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot .	neg
5053	Being unique does n't necessarily equate to being good , no matter how admirably the filmmakers have gone for broke .	neg
5054	A few hours after you 've seen it , you forget you 've been to the movies .	neg
5055	waydowntown may not be an important movie , or even a good one , but it provides a nice change of mindless pace in collision with the hot Oscar season currently underway .	pos
5056	Yes , I suppose it 's lovely that Cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his picture-perfect life -- but World Traveler gave me no reason to care , so I did n't .	neg
5059	It is not the first time that director Sara Sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time she fails to provoke them .	neg
5060	I 'd be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than Evelyn this year .	neg
5061	Nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises .	neg
5063	What remains is a variant of the nincompoop Benigni persona , here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible Sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of Road Trip .	neg
5064	A backhanded ode to female camaraderie penned by a man who has little clue about either the nature of women or of friendship .	neg
5067	Take away the controversy , and it 's not much more watchable than a Mexican soap opera .	neg
5068	It 's got the brawn , but not the brains .	neg
5069	Mindless and boring martial arts and gunplay with too little excitement and zero compelling storyline .	neg
5070	A lot of talent is wasted in this crass , low-wattage endeavor .	neg
5072	( T ) oo many of these gross out scenes ...	neg
5073	About one in three gags in White 's intermittently wise script hits its mark ; the rest are padding unashamedly appropriated from the teen-exploitation playbook .	neg
5074	Little is done to support the premise other than fling gags at it to see which ones shtick .	neg
5077	One of those films that seems tailor made to air on pay cable to offer some modest amusements when one has nothing else to watch .	neg
5078	The big ending surprise almost saves the movie .	pos
5083	It 's probably not easy to make such a worthless film ...	neg
5085	Has no reason to exist , other than to employ Hollywood kids and people who owe favors to their famous parents .	neg
5086	For a guy who has waited three years with breathless anticipation for a new Hal Hartley movie to pore over , No Such Thing is a big letdown .	neg
5087	Constantly slips from the grasp of its maker .	neg

5091	After you laugh once ( maybe twice ) , you will have completely forgotten the movie by the time you get back to your car in the parking lot .	neg
5093	In the era of The Sopranos , it feels painfully redundant and inauthentic .	neg
5094	The overall vibe is druggy and self-indulgent , like a spring-break orgy for pretentious arts majors .	neg
5095	Breen 's script is sketchy with actorish notations on the margin of acting .	neg
5097	If only Merchant paid more attention the story .	neg
5098	At the one-hour mark , Herzog simply runs out of ideas and the pace turns positively leaden as the movie sputters to its inevitable tragic conclusion .	neg
5099	... too contrived to be as naturally charming as it needs to be .	neg
5100	A simpler , leaner treatment would have been preferable ; after all , being about nothing is sometimes funnier than being about something .	neg
5101	The characters are based on stock clichés , and the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility .	neg
5102	Everything about it from the bland songs to the colorful but flat drawings is completely serviceable and quickly forgettable .	neg
5103	Not the Great American Comedy , but if you liked the previous movies in the series , you 'll have a good time with this one too .	pos
5104	A domestic melodrama with weak dialogue and biopic cliches .	neg
5105	Mr. Goyer 's loose , unaccountable direction is technically sophisticated in the worst way .	neg
5106	The movie is so thoughtlessly assembled .	pos
5108	plays like some corny television production from a bygone era	neg
5109	The end result is like cold porridge with only the odd enjoyably chewy lump .	neg
5110	For all the charm of Kevin Kline and a story that puts old-fashioned values under the microscope , there 's something creepy about this movie .	pos
5111	I was feeling this movie until it veered off too far into the Exxon zone , and left me behind at the station looking for a return ticket to realism .	neg
5112	Producer John Penotti surveyed high school students ... and came back with the astonishing revelation that `` they wanted to see something that did n't talk down to them . ''	pos

5115	Those who are not acquainted with the author 's work , on the other hand , may fall fast asleep .	neg
5116	Hoffman waits too long to turn his movie in an unexpected direction , and even then his tone retains a genteel , prep-school quality that feels dusty and leatherbound .	neg
5118	If you 're looking for a story , do n't bother .	neg
5119	Full Frontal had no effect and elicited no sympathies for any of the characters .	neg
5120	By that measure , it is a failure .	neg
5121	A baffling mixed platter of gritty realism and magic realism with a hard-to-swallow premise .	neg
5122	An affable but undernourished romantic comedy that fails to match the freshness of the actress-producer and writer 's previous collaboration , Miss Congeniality .	neg
5124	Like a pack of dynamite sticks , built for controversy .	neg
5127	An admitted egomaniac , Evans is no Hollywood villain , and yet this grating showcase almost makes you wish he 'd gone the way of Don Simpson .	neg
5128	The audience when I saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times , and that 's a bad sign when they 're supposed to be having a collective heart attack .	neg
5129	Everyone 's to blame here .	neg
5130	You get the impression that writer and director Burr Steers knows the territory ... but his sense of humor has yet to lose the smug self-satisfaction usually associated with the better private schools .	neg
5131	Less a study in madness or love than a study in schoolgirl obsession .	neg
5132	Rice never clearly defines his characters or gives us a reason to care about them .	neg
5136	But what is missing from it all is a moral .	neg
5138	Why did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery ?	neg
5140	You see the movie and you think , zzzzzzzzz .	neg
5141	Downright transparent is the script 's endless assault of embarrassingly ham-fisted sex jokes that reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a `` cooler '' PG-13 rating .	neg
5142	The movie slides downhill as soon as macho action conventions assert themselves .	neg
5143	Formulaic to the 51st power , more like .	neg
5145	Howard and his co-stars all give committed performances , but they 're often undone by Howard 's self-conscious attempts to find a ` literary ' filmmaking style to match his subject .	neg
5149	Comes off more like a misdemeanor , a flat , unconvincing drama that never catches fire .	neg

5151	`` Analyze That '' is one of those crass , contrived sequels that not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original .	neg
5153	Suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled .	neg
5154	Complex , sinuously plotted and , somehow , off-puttingly cold .	neg
5155	First-time writer-director Dylan Kidd also has a good ear for dialogue , and the characters sound like real people .	pos
5156	... an airless , prepackaged Julia Roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you 'll wonder if Lopez 's publicist should share screenwriting credit .	neg
5157	Goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though Jay Roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab .	neg
5158	Could as easily have been called ` Under Siege 3 : In Alcatraz ' ... a cinematic corpse that never springs to life .	neg
5159	In comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class London life ; despite the title ... amounts to surprisingly little .	neg
5160	Lame Sweet Home leaves no Southern stereotype unturned .	neg
5162	The jokes are sophomoric , stereotypes are sprinkled everywhere and the acting ranges from bad to bodacious .	neg
5163	Will give many ministers and Bible-study groups hours of material to discuss .	pos

5171	The first Fatal Attraction was vile enough .	neg
5172	Do we really need the Tiger Beat version ?	neg
5173	This Bond film goes off the beaten path , not necessarily for the better .	neg

5175	When the fire burns out , we 've only come face-to-face with a couple dragons and that 's where the film ultimately fails .	neg
5177	The elements were all there but lack of a pyschological center knocks it flat .	neg
5180	An unsuccessful attempt at a movie of ideas .	neg
5181	Queen of the Damned as you might have guessed , makes sorry use of Aaliyah in her one and only starring role -- she does little here but point at things that explode into flame .	neg
5182	This toothless Dog , already on cable , loses all bite on the big screen .	neg
5183	It made me feel unclean , and I 'm the guy who liked There 's Something About Mary and both American Pie movies .	neg
5185	Not only is it hokey , manipulative and as bland as Wonder Bread dipped in milk , but it also does the absolute last thing we need Hollywood doing to us : It preaches .	neg
5186	It 's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it 's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence .	neg
5187	Serving Sara should be served an eviction notice at every theater stuck with it .	neg
5189	A loud , low-budget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism ` urban drama . '	neg
5190	The movie has a script ( by Paul Pender ) made of wood , and it 's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions .	neg
5191	A pathetic exploitation film that tries to seem sincere , and just seems worse for the effort .	neg
5192	At some point , all this visual trickery stops being clever and devolves into flashy , vaguely silly overkill .	neg

5212	It is just too bad the film 's story does not live up to its style .	neg
5213	Unless you 're a fanatic , the best advice is : ` Scooby ' do n't .	neg
5214	A cautionary tale about the folly of superficiality that is itself endlessly superficial .	neg
5216	If you 're looking to rekindle the magic of the first film , you 'll need a stronger stomach than us .	neg
5217	Shreve 's graceful dual narrative gets clunky on the screen , and we keep getting torn away from the compelling historical tale to a less-compelling soap opera .	neg
5218	Contains a few big laughs but many more that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether , in part because the consciously dumbed-down approach wears thin .	neg
5219	Nothing more than a widget cranked out on an assembly line to see if stupid Americans will get a kick out of goofy Brits with cute accents performing ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks .	neg
5220	This is a film tailor-made for those who when they were in high school would choose the Cliff-Notes over reading a full-length classic .	neg
5221	The movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that 's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads .	neg
5222	A jumbled fantasy comedy that did not figure out a coherent game plan at scripting , shooting or post-production stages .	neg
5223	A sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title would imply .	neg
5225	We hate ( Madonna ) within the film 's first five minutes , and she lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground .	neg
5226	Sounding like Arnold Schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , ( Ahola ) has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that does n't produce any real transformation .	neg
5227	Two big things are missing -- anything approaching a visceral kick , and anything approaching even a vague reason to sit through it all .	neg
5229	Scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company .	neg
5231	And as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content is n't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is .	neg
5232	Too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good .	neg
5233	Apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap .	neg
5234	The sinister inspiration that fuelled DeVito 's early work is confused in Death to Smoochy into something both ugly and mindless .	neg
5235	Despite Auteuil 's performance , it 's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug .	neg
5238	Never comes together as a coherent whole .	neg
5239	An unintentionally surreal kid 's picture ... in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a VH1 Behind the Music episode .	neg
5240	First , for a movie that tries to be smart , it 's kinda dumb .	neg
5241	And second , what 's with all the shooting ?	neg
5242	Do n't even bother to rent this on video .	neg
5243	There is something in Full Frontal , I guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see .	neg
5244	This is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in September .	neg
5245	Not counting a few gross-out comedies I 've been trying to forget , this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes .	neg
5246	Plays like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of John Waters and Todd Solondz , rather than a fully developed story .	neg
5247	The film does n't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made Spy Kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences .	neg
5248	A mawkish self-parody that plays like some weird Masterpiece Theater sketch with neither a point of view nor a compelling reason for being .	neg
5249	An average B-movie with no aspirations to be anything more .	neg
5252	The plot is plastered with one Hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults .	neg
5254	A film that suffers because of its many excesses .	neg
5255	Too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient .	neg
5256	In any case , I would recommend Big Bad Love only to Winger fans who have missed her since 1995 's Forget Paris .	neg
5257	But even then , I 'd recommend waiting for DVD and just skipping straight to her scenes .	neg
5258	Depicts the sorriest and most sordid of human behavior on the screen , then laughs at how clever it 's being .	neg
5259	Nijinsky says , ' I know how to suffer ' and if you see this film you 'll know too .	neg
5260	` CQ may one day be fondly remembered as Roman Coppola 's brief pretentious period before going on to other films that actually tell a story worth caring about	neg
5261	The only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie .	neg
5262	... the story simply putters along looking for astute observations and coming up blank .	neg
5263	Instead of contriving a climactic hero 's death for the beloved-major - character-who-shall - remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens ' laser guns actually hit something for once ?	neg
5264	It just did n't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on ( or be entertained by ) .	neg
5265	This action-thriller/dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage .	neg
5266	MIB II is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything .	neg
5267	That 's because relatively nothing happens .	neg
5268	No amount of arty theorizing -- the special effects are ` German-Expressionist , ' according to the press notes -- can render it anything but laughable .	neg
5269	Blue Crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling .	neg
5270	Boyd 's screenplay ( co-written with Guardian hack Nick Davies ) has a florid turn of phrase that owes more to Guy Ritchie than the Bard of Avon .	neg
5271	There 's not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination .	neg
5272	Jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin , inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder .	neg
5273	A moving picture that does not move .	neg
5275	Romething 's really wrong with this ricture !	neg
5276	Its salient points are simultaneously buried , drowned and smothered in the excesses of writer-director Roger Avary .	neg
5277	I 'm not sure these words have ever been together in the same sentence : This erotic cannibal movie is boring .	neg
5278	` God help us , but Capra and Cooper are rolling over in their graves . '	neg
5279	... an hour-and-a-half of inoffensive , unmemorable filler .	neg
5280	Is it a comedy ?	neg
5283	A cartoon ?	neg
5286	Yes .	pos
5288	No. .	neg
5289	And that is where Ararat went astray .	neg
5290	It 's a bad sign in a thriller when you instantly know whodunit .	neg
5291	Has a customarily jovial air but a deficit of flim-flam inventiveness .	neg
5292	Eight Legged Freaks wo n't join the pantheon of great monster/science fiction flicks that we have come to love ...	neg
5293	It gets the details of its time frame right but it completely misses its emotions .	neg
5294	Who , exactly , is fighting whom here ?	neg
5295	Ah , yes , that would be me : fighting off the urge to doze .	neg
5296	A kilted Jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces .	neg
5297	Contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster .	neg
5298	Starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter .	neg
5299	The film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises .	neg
5300	The only question ... is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering .	neg
5301	Average , at best , I 'm afraid .	neg
5302	This movie is so bad , that it 's almost worth seeing because it 's so bad .	neg
5304	This movie feel more like a non-stop cry for attention , than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entertainment .	neg
5306	Love may have been in the air onscreen , but I certainly was n't feeling any of it .	neg
5307	In addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry .	neg
5308	The very definition of what critics have come to term an `` ambitious failure . ''	neg
5309	It 's as if De Palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up Kraft Macaroni and Cheese .	neg
5310	The movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter ` uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie .	neg
5311	Worthy of the gong .	neg
5312	While certainly more naturalistic than its Australian counterpart , Amari 's film falls short in building the drama of Lilia 's journey .	neg
5313	I found the movie as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it portrays .	neg
5314	The soul-searching deliberateness of the film , although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit , eventually becomes too heavy for the plot .	neg
5315	The movie does n't add anything fresh to the myth .	neg
5316	As inept as big-screen remakes of The Avengers and The Wild Wild West .	neg
5317	Comes across as a relic from a bygone era , and its convolutions ... feel silly rather than plausible .	neg
5318	Moves in such odd plot directions and descends into such message-mongering moralism that its good qualities are obscured .	neg
5319	It 's a very sincere work , but it would be better as a diary or documentary .	pos
5320	Once one experiences Mr. Haneke 's own sadistic tendencies toward his audience , one is left with a sour taste in one 's mouth , and little else .	neg
5322	That chirpy songbird Britney Spears has popped up with more mindless drivel .	neg
5323	It 's a loathsome movie , it really is and it makes absolutely no sense .	neg
5324	A chiller resolutely without chills .	neg
5325	For those of us who respond more strongly to storytelling than computer-generated effects , the new Star Wars installment has n't escaped the rut dug by the last one .	neg
5326	The director mostly plays it straight , turning Leys ' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder .	neg
5327	`` Bad '' is the operative word for `` Bad Company , '' and I do n't mean that in a good way .	neg
5328	Though Frida is easier to swallow than Julie Taymor 's preposterous Titus , the eye candy here lacks considerable brio .	neg
5329	Drumline is -- the mere suggestion , albeit a visually compelling one , of a fully realized story .	pos
5330	The whole movie is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well .	neg
5332	Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro sleepwalk through vulgarities in a sequel you can refuse .	neg
5333	It 's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert .	neg
5334	Merely ( and literally ) tosses around sex toys and offers half-hearted paeans to empowerment that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women 's expense .	neg
5335	If you want a movie time trip , the 1960 version is a far smoother ride .	neg
5337	The story is -- forgive me -- a little thin , and the filmmaking clumsy and rushed .	neg
5338	... grows decidedly flimsier with its many out-sized , out of character and logically porous action set pieces .	neg
5340	This would have been better than the fiction it has concocted , and there still could have been room for the war scenes .	neg
5341	Aggressive self-glorification and a manipulative whitewash .	neg
5342	Stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by Dustin Hoffman that is revelatory .	pos
5343	None of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest .	neg
5345	The whole film has this sneaky feel to it -- as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as Very Important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a Hollywood product .	neg
5347	The only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers .	neg
5349	Coppola has made a film of intoxicating atmosphere and little else .	pos
5350	Bad and baffling from the get-go .	neg
5351	A series of immaculately composed shots of Patch Adams quietly freaking out does not make for much of a movie .	neg
5352	At a time when we 've learned the hard way just how complex international terrorism is , Collateral Damage paints an absurdly simplistic picture .	neg
5355	Like a can of 2-day old Coke .	neg
5356	You can taste it , but there 's no fizz .	neg
5357	There 's no excuse for following up a delightful , well-crafted family film with a computer-generated cold fish .	neg
5359	But they do n't fit well together and neither is well told .	neg
5360	It 's both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts to be poignant .	neg
5361	Other than a mildly engaging central romance , Hospital is sickly entertainment at best and mind-destroying cinematic pollution at worst .	neg
5362	Jaglom offers the none-too-original premise that everyone involved with moviemaking is a con artist and a liar .	neg
5363	Outside of Burger 's desire to make some kind of film , it 's really unclear why this project was undertaken	neg
5366	Let 's see , a haunted house , a haunted ship , what 's next ... Ghost Blimp ?	neg
5367	A fragile framework upon which to hang broad , mildly fleshed-out characters that seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming .	neg
5368	By the time the plot grinds itself out in increasingly incoherent fashion , you might be wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather than the other way around .	neg
5371	Wes Craven 's presence is felt ; not the Craven of ' A Nightmare on Elm Street ' or ` The Hills Have Eyes , ' but the sad schlock merchant of ` Deadly Friend . '	neg
5373	But the cinematography is cloudy , the picture making becalmed .	neg
5374	It 's one long bore .	neg
5375	It gets old quickly .	neg
5376	Watch Barbershop again if you 're in need of a Cube fix -- this is n't worth sitting through .	neg
5377	It 's leaden and predictable , and laughs are lacking .	neg
5378	... a cinematic disaster so inadvertently sidesplitting it 's worth the price of admission for the ridicule factor alone .	neg
5379	Skip this dreck , rent Animal House and go back to the source .	neg
5380	The movie is a desperate miscalculation .	neg
5381	It gives poor Dana Carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time .	neg
5382	We just do n't really care too much about this love story .	neg
5383	In that setting , their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting .	neg
5384	The Transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull .	neg
5385	Uzumaki 's interesting social parallel and defiant aesthetic seems a prostituted muse ...	neg
5387	Large budget notwithstanding , the movie is such a blip on the year 's radar screen that it 's tempting just to go with it for the ride .	pos
5388	But this time , the old MIB label stands for Milder Is n't Better .	neg
5389	Feels familiar and tired .	neg
5390	A retread of material already thoroughly plumbed by Martin Scorsese .	neg
5391	Instead of making his own style , director Marcus Adams just copies from various sources -- good sources , bad mixture	neg
5392	Criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across racial and cultural lines in the film that it makes My Big Fat Greek Wedding look like an apartheid drama .	pos
5393	A bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points .	neg
5394	A story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material .	neg
5395	It 's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as The Country Bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at Disneyland .	neg
5396	Starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other Hollywood-action cliches .	neg
5397	Completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that I 'm not sure could be a single iota worse ... a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage .	neg
5398	An uneven look into a grim future that does n't come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendour that can be seen in other films based on Philip K. Dick stories .	neg
5399	Horrible .	neg
5400	The disjointed mess flows as naturally as Jolie 's hideous yellow ` do .	neg
5401	Bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting Love Hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that I have n't encountered since at least Pete 's Dragon .	pos
5402	An authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study in total pandemonium .	neg
5403	Makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases .	neg
5404	As the sulking , moody male hustler in the title role , ( Franco ) has all of Dean 's mannerisms and self-indulgence , but none of his sweetness and vulnerability .	neg
5405	The only thing to fear about `` Fear Dot Com '' is hitting your head on the theater seat in front of you when you doze off thirty minutes into the film .	neg
5406	It 's too interested in jerking off in all its Byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience .	neg
5407	` Synthetic ' is the best description of this well-meaning , beautifully produced film that sacrifices its promise for a high-powered star pedigree .	neg
5408	It concentrates far too much on the awkward interplay and utter lack of chemistry between Chan and Hewitt .	neg
5409	Impostor ca n't think of a thing to do with these characters except have them run through dark tunnels , fight off various anonymous attackers , and evade elaborate surveillance technologies .	neg
5410	Judd 's characters ought to pick up the durable best seller Smart Women , Foolish Choices for advice .	neg
5411	The script has less spice than a rat burger and The Rock 's fighting skills are more in line with Steven Seagal .	neg
5412	This ill-conceived and expensive project winds up looking like a bunch of talented thesps slumming it .	neg
5413	... there 's a choppy , surface-effect feeling to the whole enterprise .	neg
5414	Does n't get the job done , running off the limited chemistry created by Ralph Fiennes and Jennifer Lopez .	neg
5415	A particularly joyless , and exceedingly dull , period coming-of-age tale .	neg
5416	It 's impossible to indulge the fanciful daydreams of Janice Beard ( Eileen Walsh ) when her real-life persona is so charmless and vacant .	neg
5417	... it was n't the subject matter that ultimately defeated the film ... It was the unfulfilling , incongruous , `` wait a second , did I miss something ? ''	neg
5419	This is a movie where the most notable observation is how long you 've been sitting still .	neg
5420	Poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action .	neg
5421	It 's super - violent , super-serious and super-stupid .	neg
5423	Just a string of stale gags , with no good inside dope , and no particular bite .	neg
5424	It 's Splash without the jokes .	neg
5425	The Château would have been benefited from a sharper , cleaner script before it went in front of the camera .	neg
5427	Shallow , noisy and pretentious .	neg
5428	Morrissette has performed a difficult task indeed - he 's taken one of the world 's most fascinating stories and made it dull , lifeless , and irritating .	neg
5430	This loud and thoroughly obnoxious comedy about a pair of squabbling working-class spouses is a deeply unpleasant experience .	neg
5431	It 's better than The Phantom Menace .	pos
5432	But unless you 're an absolute raving Star Wars junkie , it is n't much fun .	neg
5433	Philosophically , intellectually and logistically a mess .	neg
5434	A standard police-oriented drama that , were it not for De Niro 's participation , would have likely wound up a TNT Original .	neg
5435	Coupling disgracefully written dialogue with flailing bodily movements that substitute for acting , Circuit is the awkwardly paced soap opera-ish story .	neg
5436	Hollywood Ending just is n't very funny .	neg
5437	Though clearly well-intentioned , this cross-cultural soap opera is painfully formulaic and stilted .	neg
5438	A technical triumph and an extraordinary bore .	neg
5439	I can easily imagine Benigni 's Pinocchio becoming a Christmas perennial .	pos
5440	Coal is n't as easy to come by as it used to be and this would be a worthy substitute for naughty children 's stockings .	neg
5441	Two hours of junk .	neg
5444	A clumsily manufactured exploitation flick , a style-free exercise in manipulation and mayhem .	neg
5445	The whole affair , true story or not , feels incredibly hokey ... ( it ) comes off like a Hallmark commercial .	neg
5446	What 's missing is what we call the ` wow ' factor .	neg
5447	The nicest thing that can be said about Stealing Harvard ( which might have been called Freddy Gets Molested by a Dog ) is that it 's not as obnoxious as Tom Green 's Freddie Got Fingered .	neg
5448	... Tara Reid plays a college journalist , but she looks like the six-time winner of the Miss Hawaiian Tropic Pageant , so I do n't know what she 's doing in here ...	neg
5449	The young stars are too cute ; the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative ; the message is too blatant ; the resolutions are too convenient .	neg
5450	Normally , Rohmer 's talky films fascinate me , but when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable .	neg
5452	It 's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since I last walked out on a movie , but Resident Evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure .	neg
5453	This picture is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer .	neg
5455	But the movie 's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure .	neg
5456	Though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen The Hunger or Cat People will find little new here , but a tasty performance from Vincent Gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary .	pos
5457	A Blair Witch - style adventure that plays like a bad soap opera , with passable performances from everyone in the cast .	neg
5458	Diaz wears out her welcome in her most charmless performance	neg
5459	It is too bad that this likable movie is n't more accomplished .	neg
5460	The actors try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward .	neg
5461	The plot has a number of holes , and at times it 's simply baffling .	neg
5462	An ill-conceived jumble that 's not scary , not smart and not engaging .	neg
5463	Brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , Deuces Wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism .	neg
5464	Gets bogged down by an overly sillified plot and stop-and-start pacing .	neg
5466	Like coming into a long-running , well-written television series where you 've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably wo n't see the next six .	neg
5467	Its generic villains lack any intrigue ( other than their funny accents ) and the action scenes are poorly delivered .	neg
5468	Dripping with cliche and bypassing no opportunity to trivialize the material .	neg
5469	Hard-core slasher aficionados will find things to like ... but overall the Halloween series has lost its edge .	neg
5470	Stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed .	neg
5471	The story the movie tells is of Brian De Palma 's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career .	neg
5474	With tiny little jokes and nary an original idea , this sappy ethnic sleeper proves that not only blockbusters pollute the summer movie pool .	neg
5475	It sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations .	neg
5476	Ever see one of those comedies that just seem like a bad idea from frame one ?	neg
5477	Once Ice-T sticks his mug in the window of the couple 's BMW and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue , all credibility flies out the window .	neg
5479	Quitting , however , manages just to be depressing , as the lead actor phones in his autobiographical performance .	neg
5480	It would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi .	neg
5482	For most movies , 84 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence .	neg
5484	Shatner is probably the funniest person in the film , which gives you an idea just how bad it was .	neg
5485	Tries so hard to be quirky and funny that the strain is all too evident .	neg
5486	As immaculate as Stuart Little 2 is , it could be a lot better if it were , well , more adventurous .	pos
5487	Simply a re-hash of the other seven films .	neg
5488	With jump cuts , fast editing and lots of pyrotechnics , Yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is .	neg
5489	He fails .	neg
5491	A very depressing movie of many missed opportunities .	neg
5492	Goes on and on to the point of nausea .	neg
5493	By turns numbingly dull-witted and disquietingly creepy .	neg
5494	Boy , has this franchise ever run out of gas .	neg
5495	One problem with the movie , directed by Joel Schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time .	neg
5496	The comedy is nonexistent .	neg
5497	... a bland , pretentious mess .	neg
5498	It 's a pedestrian , flat drama that screams out ` amateur ' in almost every frame .	neg
5499	A bland animated sequel that hardly seems worth the effort .	neg
5500	It 's not just the vampires that are damned in Queen of the Damned -- the viewers will feel they suffer the same fate .	neg
5501	If religious films are n't your bailiwick , stay away .	neg
5502	Otherwise , this could be a passable date film .	neg
5503	This is the case of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience .	neg
5505	Stuffy , full of itself , morally ambiguous and nothing to shout about .	neg
5506	It is most of the things Costner movies are known for ; it 's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it .	neg
5507	Do n't let the subtitles fool you ; the movie only proves that Hollywood no longer has a monopoly on mindless action .	neg
5508	Chai 's structure and pacing are disconcertingly slack .	neg
5509	To be oblivious to the existence of this film would be very sweet indeed .	neg
5510	The director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone .	neg
5512	Instead of panoramic sweep , Kapur gives us episodic choppiness , undermining the story 's emotional thrust .	neg
5513	The director seems to take an unseemly pleasure in ( the characters ' ) misery and at the same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it .	neg
5514	This dubious product of a college-spawned ( Colgate U. ) comedy ensemble known as Broken Lizard plays like a mix of Cheech and Chong and CHiPs .	neg
5515	The movie does n't think much of its characters , its protagonist , or of us .	neg
5518	After seeing the film , I can tell you that there 's no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it .	neg
5520	As a kind of colorful , dramatized PBS program , Frida gets the job done .	pos

5832	Contrived , maudlin and cliche-ridden ... if this sappy script was the best the contest received , those rejected must have been astronomically bad .	neg
5833	I hate the feeling of having been slimed in the name of High Art .	neg
5836	The kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else ; their parents , wise folks that they are , read books .	neg
5837	Whether Jason X is this bad on purpose is never clear .	neg
5838	But one thing 's for sure : It never comes close to being either funny or scary .	neg
5840	I like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material , but they 're treading water at best in this forgettable effort .	pos
5842	is that it 's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime .	neg
5844	This insufferable movie is meant to make you think about existential suffering .	neg
5845	Instead , it 'll only put you to sleep .	neg
5848	It 's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are ` edgy . '	neg
5849	A sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and an overly-familiar set of plot devices .	neg
5850	It 's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in Bridget Jones 's Diary .	neg
5851	Almost as offensive as `` Freddy Got Fingered . ''	neg
5852	The gifted Crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself , and his cipherlike personality and bad behavior would play fine if the movie knew what to do with him .	neg
5853	It is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound .	neg
5854	Ponderous , plodding soap opera disguised as a feature film .	neg
5855	Cold , pretentious , thoroughly dislikable study in sociopathy .	neg
5856	For the future , one hopes Mr. Plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter .	neg
5857	A cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at Revolution Studios and Imagine Entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $ 9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life .	neg
5858	Reign of Fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise , but it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness .	neg
5859	Human Nature is a goofball movie , in the way that Malkovich was , but it tries too hard .	pos
5860	Originality is sorely lacking .	neg
5862	But while the highly predictable narrative falls short , Treasure Planet is truly gorgeous to behold .	pos
5863	Though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie 's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker 's flailing reputation .	neg
5866	For a story set at sea , Ghost Ship is pretty landbound , with its leaden acting , dull exposition and telegraphed ` surprises . '	neg
5867	There might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here , but who the hell cares ?	neg
5868	Nothing more than a stifling morality tale dressed up in peekaboo clothing .	neg
5869	I like my Christmas movies with more elves and snow and less pimps and ho 's .	neg
5870	It all seemed wasted like DeNiro 's once promising career and the once grand Long Beach boardwalk .	neg
5871	( I ) t 's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context , but Barbershop is n't as funny as it should be .	neg
5872	Unfortunately , a cast of competent performers from movies , television and the theater are cast adrift in various New York City locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style .	neg
5875	Equilibrium the movie , as opposed to the manifesto , is really , really stupid .	neg
5876	Excruciatingly unfunny and pitifully unromantic .	neg
5877	The film 's thoroughly recycled plot and tiresome jokes ... drag the movie down .	neg
5878	It does n't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject .	neg
5879	This kiddie-oriented stinker is so bad that I even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater	neg
5880	Though Impostor deviously adopts the guise of a modern motion picture , it too is a bomb .	neg
5881	Cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos , but there are no movies of Nijinsky , so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge .	neg
5882	Every note rings false .	neg
5883	When the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year , you 'd have a hard time believing it was just coincidence .	neg
5884	It never rises to its clever what-if concept .	neg
5886	This story of unrequited love does n't sustain interest beyond the first half-hour .	neg
5887	This angst-ridden territory was covered earlier and much better in Ordinary People .	neg
5888	The entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another .	neg
5889	About half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal .	neg
5890	A big , loud , bang-the-drum bore .	neg
5891	( Less a movie than ) an appalling , odoriferous thing ... so rotten in almost every single facet of production that you 'll want to crawl up your own *** in embarrassment .	neg
5892	The concept behind Kung Pow : Enter the Fist is hilarious .	pos
5895	El Crimen Del Padre Amaro would likely be most effective if used as a tool to rally anti-Catholic protestors .	neg
5896	Interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of Carmen	pos
5897	A serious movie with serious ideas .	pos
5898	But seriously , folks , it does n't work .	neg
5899	There 's nothing exactly wrong here , but there 's not nearly enough that 's right .	neg
5900	The action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises .	neg
5901	I could n't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy .	neg
5902	What Madonna does here ca n't properly be called acting -- more accurately , it 's moving and it 's talking and it 's occasionally gesturing , sometimes all at once .	neg
5903	( A ) painfully flat gross-out comedy ...	neg
5904	Even if you 're an Elvis person , you wo n't find anything to get excited about on this DVD .	neg
5906	It 's bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction .	neg
5907	I 'm sure there 's a teenage boy out there somewhere who 's dying for this kind of entertainment .	neg
5908	The Tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life .	neg
5909	The film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama .	neg
5910	Obviously , a lot of people wasted a lot of their time ( including mine ) on something very inconsequential .	neg
5911	There 's a little violence and lots of sex in a bid to hold our attention , but it grows monotonous after a while , as do Joan and Philip 's repetitive arguments , schemes and treachery .	neg
5912	It drowns in sap .	neg
5913	Deliberately and devotedly constructed , Far from Heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate .	pos
5914	It 's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; everything that 's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that 's just too boring and obvious .	neg
5915	I 'm giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment .	neg
5916	There 's got to be a more graceful way of portraying the devastation of this disease .	neg
5918	The modern-day characters are nowhere near as vivid as the 19th-century ones .	neg
5919	Blessed with a searing lead performance by Ryan Gosling ( Murder by Numbers ) , the movie is powerful and provocative .	pos
5920	It 's also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness .	neg
5921	Uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth .	neg
5922	Director Jay Russell stomps in hobnail boots over Natalie Babbitt 's gentle , endearing 1975 children 's novel .	neg
5924	The troubling thing about Clockstoppers is that it does n't make any sense .	neg
5925	With its paint fights , motorized scooter chases and dewy-eyed sentiment , it 's a pretty listless collection of kid-movie clichés .	neg
5927	Kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper .	neg
5928	A rote exercise in both animation and storytelling .	neg
5929	The material and the production itself are little more than routine .	neg
5930	The movie 's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it 's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had .	neg
5931	Not even Steven Spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie .	neg
5932	It 's all surface psychodramatics .	neg
5933	The Mothman Prophecies , which is mostly a bore , seems to exist only for its climactic setpiece .	neg
5934	That frenetic spectacle ( on the TV show ) has usually been leavened by a charm that 's conspicuously missing from the Girls ' big-screen blowout .	neg
5935	Kitschy , flashy , overlong soap opera .	neg
5936	For all the time we spend with these people , we never really get inside of them .	neg
5937	Yet another Arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate use of his particular talents .	neg
5938	Sandra Bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ai n't - she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff .	neg
5939	An undistinguished attempt to make a classic theater piece cinematic .	neg
5940	too many scenarios in which the hero might have an opportunity to triumphantly sermonize , and too few that allow us to wonder for ourselves if things will turn out okay .	neg
5941	There is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventy-minute running time .	neg
5943	Broomfield 's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient .	neg
5944	( Seagal 's ) strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year 's Razzie .	neg
5945	Has the disjointed feel of a bunch of strung-together TV episodes .	neg
5946	A series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander , some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story .	neg
5947	Ozpetek offers an AIDS subtext , skims over the realities of gay sex , and presents yet another tired old vision of the gay community as an all-inclusive world where uptight , middle class bores like Antonia can feel good about themselves .	neg
5949	The Sweetest Thing is expressly for idiots who do n't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance .	neg
5950	Sinks so low in a poorly played game of absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even Freeman ca n't save it .	neg
5952	It made me realize that we really have n't had a good cheesy B-movie playing in theaters since ... well ... since last week 's Reign of Fire .	neg
5953	Some movies were made for the big screen , some for the small screen , and some , like Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever , were made for the palm screen .	neg
5954	SC2 is an autopilot Hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic Christmas spirit , yet it 's geared toward an audience full of masters of both .	neg
5956	Seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , and it 's a sad , sick sight .	neg
5957	It 's refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy ; Diesel , with his brawny frame and cool , composed delivery , fits the bill perfectly .	pos
5959	Suffers from a flat script and a low budget .	neg
5960	There are deeply religious and spiritual people in this world who would argue that entering a church , synagogue or temple does n't mean you have to check your brain at the door .	pos
5962	Seemingly a vehicle to showcase the Canadian 's inane ramblings , Stealing Harvard is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former Mr. Drew Barrymore .	neg
5965	This franchise has not spawned a single good film .	neg
5966	The crap continues .	neg
5967	Its inescapable absurdities are tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who has n't been living under a rock ( since Sept. 11 ) .	neg
5968	High drama , Disney-style - a wing and a prayer and a hunky has-been pursuing his castle in the sky .	pos
5969	Like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire Olympic swim team through , the characters in Swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover .	neg
5970	One big blustery movie where nothing really happens .	neg
5971	When it comes out on video , then it 's the perfect cure for insomnia .	neg
5972	Like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop , Comedian runs out of steam after a half hour .	neg
5973	The pairing does sound promising in theory ... but their lack of chemistry makes Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro in Showtime look like old , familiar vaudeville partners .	neg
5976	I could just feel the screenwriter at every moment ` Tap , tap , tap , tap , tapping away ' on this screenplay .	neg
5978	A stupid , derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense .	neg
5979	The rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey .	neg
5980	Roman Polanski directs The Pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart ; very meticulously but without any passion .	neg
5983	This is an action movie with an action icon who 's been all but decommissioned .	neg
5984	Even if it is generally amusing from time to time , I Spy has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have .	neg
5985	Much like Robin Williams , Death to Smoochy has already reached its expiration date .	neg
5986	An annoying orgy of excess and exploitation that has no point and goes nowhere .	neg
5987	A tired , unnecessary retread ... a stale copy of a picture that was n't all that great to begin with .	neg
5989	A worthy idea , but the uninspired scripts , acting and direction never rise above the level of an after-school TV special .	neg
5991	Ear-splitting exercise in formula crash-and-bash action .	neg
5995	The emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down .	neg
5996	Schaefer 's ... determination to inject farcical raunch ... drowns out the promise of the romantic angle .	neg
5997	Like Showgirls and Glitter , the most entertaining moments here are unintentional .	neg
5998	While some of the camera work is interesting , the film 's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work .	neg
6000	It 's in the action scenes that things fall apart .	neg
6001	Impostor is a step down for director Gary Fleder .	neg
6002	Seagal , who looks more like Danny Aiello these days , mumbles his way through the movie .	neg
6003	The movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents .	neg
6004	Lacks dramatic punch and depth .	neg
6006	I can analyze this movie in three words : Thumbs Friggin ' Down .	neg
6007	Sadly , ` Garth ' has n't progressed as nicely as ` Wayne . '	neg
6008	Make like the title and dodge this one .	neg
6009	This is not one of the movies you 'd want to watch if you only had a week to live .	neg
6010	The first hour is tedious though Ford and Neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie .	neg
6011	Here 's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior .	neg
6014	( Green is ) the comedy equivalent of Saddam Hussein , and I 'm just about ready to go to the U.N. and ask permission for a preemptive strike .	neg
6015	No amount of good acting is enough to save Oleander 's uninspired story .	neg
6016	A vile , incoherent mess ... a scummy ripoff of David Cronenberg 's brilliant ` Videodrome . '	neg
6017	Murphy and Wilson actually make a pretty good team ... but the project surrounding them is distressingly rote .	neg
6019	Think The Lion King redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs by Bryan Adams , the world 's most generic rock star .	neg
6022	A small fortune in salaries and stunt cars might have been saved if the director , Tom Dey , had spliced together bits and pieces of Midnight Run and 48 Hours ( and , for that matter , Shrek ) .	neg
6023	An amateurish , quasi-improvised acting exercise shot on ugly digital video .	neg
6024	The holes in this film remain agape -- holes punched through by an inconsistent , meandering , and sometimes dry plot .	neg
6025	Would Benigni 's Italian Pinocchio have been any easier to sit through than this hastily dubbed disaster ?	neg
6027	Officially , it is twice as bestial but half as funny .	neg
6028	This is a fragmented film , once a good idea that was followed by the bad idea to turn it into a movie .	neg
6029	Mindless yet impressively lean spinoff of last summer 's bloated effects fest The Mummy Returns .	pos
6030	Halfway through the movie , the humor dwindles .	neg
6031	It 's replaced by some dramatic scenes that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have ( and probably should have ) been a lighthearted comedy .	neg
6034	Control-Alt-Delete Simone as quickly as possible	neg
6035	Follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun .	neg
6038	Has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies ...	neg
6039	Vaguely interesting , but it 's just too too much .	neg
6040	... no charm , no laughs , no fun , no reason to watch .	neg
6041	A generic family comedy unlikely to be appreciated by anyone outside the under-10 set .	neg
6042	Kung Pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after Oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party .	neg
6043	Kurys seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business .	neg
6045	A manipulative feminist empowerment tale thinly posing as a serious drama about spousal abuse .	neg
6046	Everything in Maid in Manhattan is exceedingly pleasant , designed not to offend .	pos
6047	It goes down easy , leaving virtually no aftertaste .	pos
6048	A profoundly stupid affair , populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility .	neg
6049	... pays tribute to heroes the way Julia Roberts hands out awards -- with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism .	neg
6050	Time stands still in more ways that one in Clockstoppers , a sci-fi thriller as lazy as it is interminable .	neg
6051	As a director , Eastwood is off his game -- there 's no real sense of suspense , and none of the plot ` surprises ' are really surprising .	neg
6056	A puzzle whose pieces do not fit .	neg
6058	Would that Greengrass had gone a tad less for grit and a lot more for intelligibility .	neg
6060	` Butterfingered ' is the word for the big-fisted direction of Jez Butterworth , who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach .	neg
6061	Be forewarned , if you 're depressed about anything before watching this film , you may just end up trying to drown yourself in a lake afterwards .	neg
6062	a terrible adaptation of a play that only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome .	neg
6063	In the wrong hands , i.e. Peploe 's , it 's simply unbearable	neg
6064	An inexperienced director , Mehta has much to learn .	neg
6065	A limp Eddie Murphy vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of .	neg
6066	So muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker 's characteristic style .	neg
6067	A gushy episode of `` M * A * S * H '' only this time from an Asian perspective .	neg
6068	`` Looking For Leonard '' just seems to kinda sit in neutral , hoping for a stiff wind to blow it uphill or something .	neg
6069	Nothing more than four or five mild chuckles surrounded by 86 minutes of overly-familiar and poorly-constructed comedy .	neg
6070	Definitely in the guilty pleasure B-movie category , Reign of Fire is so incredibly inane that it is laughingly enjoyable .	pos
6071	Good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like Clueless Does South Fork .	neg
6072	entertaining enough , but nothing new	neg
6073	... one resurrection too many .	neg
6074	This is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout .	neg
6075	Even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached .	neg
6077	In spite of featuring a script credited to no fewer than five writers , apparently nobody here bothered to check it twice .	neg
6078	No one involved , save Dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director Abdul Malik Abbott and Ernest ` Tron ' Anderson , seems entirely improvised .	neg
6079	Initially gripping , eventually cloying POW drama .	pos
6080	A timid , soggy near miss .	neg
6081	Works better in the conception than it does in the execution ... winds up seeming just a little too clever .	neg
6082	To the vast majority of more casual filmgoers , it will probably be a talky bore .	neg
6086	Shunji Iwai 's All About Lily Chou Chou is a beautifully shot , but ultimately flawed film about growing up in Japan .	neg
6087	With more character development this might have been an eerie thriller ; with better payoffs , it could have been a thinking man 's monster movie .	neg
6090	There 's not a single jump-in-your-seat moment and believe it or not , Jason actually takes a backseat in his own film to special effects .	neg
6091	Goldbacher draws on an elegant visual sense and a talent for easy , seductive pacing ... but she and writing partner Laurence Coriat do n't manage an equally assured narrative coinage .	pos
6092	Though Harris is affecting at times , he can not overcome the sense that Pumpkin is a mere plot pawn for two directors with far less endearing disabilities .	neg
6093	The documentary is much too conventional -- lots of boring talking heads , etc. -- to do the subject matter justice .	neg
6094	The movie itself appears to be running on hypertime in reverse as the truly funny bits get further and further apart .	neg
6095	This is not a Jackie Chan movie .	neg
6096	It 's just a movie that happens to have Jackie Chan in it .	neg
6097	And that makes all the difference .	pos
6098	Far too clever by half , Howard 's film is really a series of strung-together moments , with all the spaces in between filled with fantasies , daydreams , memories and one fantastic visual trope after another .	neg
6099	The problem with movies about angels is they have a tendency to slip into hokum .	neg
6100	A Rumor of Angels does n't just slip -- it avalanches into forced fuzziness .	neg
6101	No big whoop , nothing new to see , zero thrills , too many flashbacks and a choppy ending make for a bad film .	neg
6102	I do n't think this movie loves women at all .	neg
6103	Shankman ... and screenwriter Karen Janszen bungle their way through the narrative as if it were a series of Bible parables and not an actual story .	neg
6104	A negligible British comedy .	neg
6105	Fails to convince the audience that these brats will ever be anything more than losers .	neg
6106	Slack and uninspired , and peopled mainly by characters so unsympathetic that you 're left with a sour taste in your mouth .	neg
6107	Skip this turd and pick your nose instead because you 're sure to get more out of the latter experience .	neg
6109	Trailer trash cinema so uncool the only thing missing is the `` Gadzooks ! ''	neg
6110	Her film is like a beautiful food entrée that is n't heated properly , so that it ends up a bit cold and relatively flavorless .	neg
6111	Like the world of his film , Hartley created a monster but did n't know how to handle it .	neg
6112	No new plot conceptions or environmental changes , just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through .	neg
6113	Needs more impressionistic cinematography and exhilarating point-of-view shots and fewer slow-motion ` grandeur ' shots and quick-cut edits that often detract from the athleticism .	neg
6114	In the end , there is n't much to it .	neg
6115	A waste of fearless purity in the acting craft .	neg
6116	The film is ultimately about as inspiring as a Hallmark card .	neg
6117	Anyone not into high-tech splatterfests is advised to take the warning literally , and log on to something more user-friendly .	neg
6118	Disreputable doings and exquisite trappings are dampened by a lackluster script and substandard performances .	neg
6119	You could easily mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time .	neg
6121	Yet another entry in the sentimental oh-those-wacky-Brits genre that was ushered in by The Full Monty and is still straining to produce another smash hit .	neg
6122	for those for whom the name Woody Allen was once a guarantee of something fresh , sometimes funny , and usually genuinely worthwhile , Hollywood Ending is a depressing experience	neg
6123	Femme Fatale offers nothing more than a bait-and-switch that is beyond playing fair with the audience .	neg
6124	Are we dealing with dreams , visions or being told what actually happened as if it were the third ending of Clue ?	neg
6125	It could have been something special , but two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director Clare Peploe 's misunderstanding of Marivaux 's rhythms , and Mira Sorvino 's limitations as a classical actress .	neg
6126	Fluffy neo-noir hiding behind cutesy film references .	neg
6127	Imagine Susan Sontag falling in love with Howard Stern .	neg
6129	Should have been worth cheering as a breakthrough but is devoid of wit and humor .	neg
6130	The best thing about the movie is its personable , amusing cast .	pos
6131	These guys seem great to knock back a beer with but they 're simply not funny performers .	neg
6132	Everything was as superficial as the forced New Jersey lowbrow accent Uma had .	neg
6133	Director David Fincher and writer David Koepp ca n't sustain it .	neg
6136	One of the most highly-praised disappointments I 've had the misfortune to watch in quite some time .	neg
6138	Director Shekhar Kapur and screenwriters Michael Schiffer and Hossein Amini have tried hard to modernize and reconceptualize things , but the barriers finally prove to be too great .	neg
6139	Strong filmmaking requires a clear sense of purpose , and in that oh-so-important category , The Four Feathers comes up short .	neg
6140	The thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humour and reinforcement of stereotypes ( of which they 'll get plenty ) fills me with revulsion .	neg
6141	Devolves into the derivative , leaning on badly-rendered CGI effects .	neg
6143	A grand fart coming from a director beginning to resemble someone 's crazy French grandfather .	neg
6144	The script is a disaster , with cloying messages and irksome characters .	neg
6147	Hollywood has taken quite a nosedive from Alfred Hitchcock 's imaginative flight to Shyamalan 's self-important summer fluff .	neg
6148	The film 's maudlin focus on the young woman 's infirmity and her naive dreams play like the worst kind of Hollywood heart-string plucking .	neg
6149	I firmly believe that a good video game movie is going to show up soon .	pos
6150	I also believe that Resident Evil is not it .	neg
6151	It has the air of a surprisingly juvenile lark , a pop-influenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent and wear thin with repetition .	neg
6153	This is cruel , misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy .	neg
6154	No amount of nostalgia for Carvey 's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that Carvey 's considerable talents are wasted in it .	neg
6158	Lazily directed by Charles Stone III ... from a leaden script by Matthew Cirulnick and novelist Thulani Davis .	neg
6159	Though Jones and Snipes are enthralling , the movie bogs down in rhetoric and cliché .	neg
6161	An artsploitation movie with too much exploitation and too little art .	neg
6162	The pacing is often way off and there are too many bona fide groaners among too few laughs .	neg

6165	Writer/director Burr Steers emphasizes the Q in Quirky , with mixed results .	pos
6166	One senses in World Traveler and in his earlier film that Freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact .	neg
6167	In between the icy stunts , the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and ` just letting the mountain tell you what to do . '	pos
6170	is a mess .	neg
6171	Hypnotically dull , relentlessly downbeat , laughably predictable wail pitched to the cadence of a depressed fifteen-year-old 's suicidal poetry .	neg
6172	The concept is a hoot .	pos
6173	The trailer is a riot .	pos
6174	The movie is a dud .	neg
6175	It 's a boring movie about a boring man , made watchable by a bravura performance from a consummate actor incapable of being boring .	pos
6176	Because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags .	neg
6177	It 's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie .	neg
6179	These characters become wearisome .	neg
6180	A hit - and-miss affair , consistently amusing but not as outrageous or funny as Cho may have intended or as imaginative as one might have hoped .	neg
6181	This may be the first cartoon ever to look as if it were being shown on the projection television screen of a sports bar .	neg
6182	Kim Ki-Deok seems to have in mind an ( emotionally at least ) adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested .	neg
6184	After sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if Lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work .	neg
6185	Contrived pastiche of caper clichés .	neg
6191	Despite its sincere acting , Signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype .	neg
6193	Loud , chaotic and largely unfunny .	neg
6195	Qualities that were once amusing are becoming irritating .	neg
6196	Well , Jason 's gone to Manhattan and Hell , I guess a space station in the year 2455 can be crossed off the list of ideas for the inevitable future sequels ( hey , do n't shoot the messenger ) .	neg
6197	Donovan ... squanders his main asset , Jackie Chan , and fumbles the vital action sequences .	neg
6198	There is no psychology here , and no real narrative logic -- just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract .	neg
6199	Bread , My Sweet has so many flaws it would be easy for critics to shred it .	neg
6203	Leaks treacle from every pore .	neg
6204	The characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue CIA assassins working for Chris Cooper 's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac , we do n't feel much for Damon/Bourne or his predicament .	neg
6205	Kapur weighs down the tale with bogus profundities .	neg
6207	Blue Crush is as predictable as the tides .	neg
6208	... The movie feels stitched together from stock situations and characters from other movies .	neg
6209	If you enjoy being rewarded by a script that assumes you are n't very bright , then Blood Work is for you .	neg
6210	Trouble Every Day is a success in some sense , but it 's hard to like a film so cold and dead .	neg
6212	A well-intentioned effort that 's still too burdened by the actor 's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility .	neg
6218	Any reasonably creative eighth-grader could have written a more credible script , though with the same number of continuity errors .	neg
6219	... while the humor aspects of ` Jason X ' were far more entertaining than I had expected , everything else about the film tanks .	neg
6221	Like an Afterschool Special with costumes by Gianni Versace , Mad Love looks better than it feels .	neg
6223	The script , the gags , the characters are all direct-to-video stuff , and that 's where this film should have remained .	neg
6224	A thriller without thrills and a mystery devoid of urgent questions .	neg
6225	A collage of clichés and a dim echo of allusions to other films .	neg
6226	The film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters .	neg
6228	An excruciating demonstration of the unsalvageability of a movie saddled with an amateurish screenplay .	neg
6229	How many more times will indie filmmakers subject us to boring , self-important stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other ?	neg
6230	There are some laughs in this movie , but Williams ' anarchy gets tiresome , the satire is weak .	neg
6231	As steamy as last week 's pork dumplings .	neg
6232	The somber pacing and lack of dramatic fireworks make Green Dragon seem more like medicine than entertainment .	neg
6233	The filmmakers needed more emphasis on the storytelling and less on the glamorous machine that thrusts the audience into a future they wo n't much care about .	neg
6234	Another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing , moldering pile of , well , extreme stunt pictures .	neg
6235	This strenuously unfunny Showtime deserves the hook .	neg
6236	The whole thing 's fairly lame , making it par for the course for Disney sequels .	neg
6237	... its solemn pretension prevents us from sharing the awe in which it holds itself .	neg
6238	... the good and different idea ( of middle-aged romance ) is not handled well and , except for the fine star performances , there is little else to recommend `` Never Again . ''	neg
6239	If Disney 's Cinderella proved that ' a dream is a wish your heart makes , ' then Cinderella II proves that a nightmare is a wish a studio 's wallet makes .	neg
6240	Features nonsensical and laughable plotting , wooden performances , ineptly directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory .	neg
6242	Nothing about this movie works .	neg
6244	A spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged .	neg
6245	None of Birthday Girl 's calculated events take us by surprise ...	neg
6247	Lisa Rinzler 's cinematography may be lovely , but Love Liza 's tale itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout , maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension .	neg
6248	The narrator and the other characters try to convince us that acting transfigures Esther , but she 's never seen speaking on stage ; one feels cheated , and Esther seems to remain an unchanged dullard .	neg
6249	It 's exactly the kind of movie Toback 's detractors always accuse him of making .	neg
6250	With the dog days of August upon us , think of this dog of a movie as the cinematic equivalent of high humidity .	neg
6252	The film is like sitting in a downtown café , overhearing a bunch of typical late-twenty-somethings natter on about nothing , and desperately wishing you could change tables .	neg
6253	This rather unfocused , all-over-the-map movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens ... or if it were subtler ... or if it had a sense of humor .	neg
6254	Takes a clunky TV-movie approach to detailing a chapter in the life of the celebrated Irish playwright , poet and drinker .	neg
6255	Not only does the thoroughly formulaic film represent totally exemplify middle-of-the-road mainstream , it also represents glossy Hollywood at its laziest .	neg
6256	A shame that Stealing Harvard is too busy getting in its own way to be anything but frustrating , boring , and forgettable .	neg
6257	Nearly every attempt at humor here is DOA .	neg
6258	Collapses under its own meager weight .	neg
6261	Technically and artistically inept .	neg
6262	Those who are only mildly curious , I fear , will be put to sleep or bewildered by the artsy and often pointless visuals .	neg
6263	Though Tom Shadyac 's film kicks off spookily enough , around the halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance .	neg
6264	A long , dull procession of despair , set to cello music culled from a minimalist funeral .	neg
6265	Call me a cold-hearted curmudgeon for not being able to enjoy a mindless action movie , but I believe a movie can be mindless without being the peak of all things insipid .	neg
6266	Death might be a release .	neg
6267	`` ( Hopkins ) does n't so much phone in his performance as fax it .	neg
6268	No , even that 's too committed .	neg
6270	Sodden and glum , even in those moments where it 's supposed to feel funny and light .	neg
6271	Priggish , lethargically paced parable of renewal .	neg
6272	A beautifully shot but dull and ankle-deep ` epic . '	neg
6273	Even with its $ 50-million US budget , Pinocchio never quite achieves the feel of a fanciful motion picture .	neg
6274	This is a third-person story now , told by Hollywood , and much more ordinary for it .	neg
6275	The filmmakers know how to please the eye , but it is not always the prettiest pictures that tell the best story .	pos
6276	Written , flatly , by David Kendall and directed , barely , by There 's Something About Mary co-writer Ed Decter .	neg
6280	You leave the same way you came -- a few tasty morsels under your belt , but no new friends .	neg
6281	It 's depressing to see how far Herzog has fallen .	neg
6283	but rather , ` How can you charge money for this ? '	neg
6284	Millions of dollars heaped upon a project of such vast proportions need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry .	neg
6285	`` Freaky Friday , '' it 's not .	neg
6286	Perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that is n't this painfully forced , false and fabricated .	neg
6287	Although no pastry is violated , this nasty comedy pokes fun at the same easy targets as other rowdy raunch-fests -- farts , boobs , unmentionables -- without much success .	neg
6289	Maybe you 'll be lucky , and there 'll be a power outage during your screening so you can get your money back .	neg
6290	The characterizations and dialogue lack depth or complexity , with the ironic exception of Scooter .	neg
6292	For the rest of us , sitting through Dahmer 's two hours amounts to little more than punishment .	neg
6294	Somewhere inside the mess that is World Traveler , there is a mediocre movie trying to get out .	neg
6297	An artful yet depressing film that makes a melodramatic mountain out of the molehill of a missing bike .	neg
6298	The movie 's ultimate point -- that everyone should be themselves -- is trite , but the screenwriter and director Michel Gondry restate it to the point of ridiculousness .	neg
6300	... expands the horizons of boredom to the point of collapse , turning into a black hole of dullness , from which no interesting concept can escape .	neg
6302	Sad nonsense , this .	neg
6303	But not without cheesy fun factor .	pos
6304	One of those decades-spanning historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time .	neg
6306	The movie wavers between Hallmark card sentimentality and goofy , life-affirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial .	neg
6307	The director 's many dodges and turns add up to little more than a screenful of gamesmanship that 's low on both suspense and payoff .	neg
6308	While the transgressive trappings ( especially the frank sex scenes ) ensure that the film is never dull , Rodrigues 's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative .	neg
6309	The satire is unfocused , while the story goes nowhere .	neg
6310	They threw loads of money at an idea that should 've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans .	neg
6311	It 's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of Action Man cliché atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of ( Woo 's ) best work .	neg
6312	Reyes ' directorial debut has good things to offer , but ultimately it 's undone by a sloppy script	neg
6313	If you 're over 25 , have an IQ over 90 , and have a driver 's license , you should be able to find better entertainment .	neg
6314	The darker elements of misogyny and unprovoked violence suffocate the illumination created by the two daughters and the sparse instances of humor meant to shine through the gloomy film noir veil .	neg
6316	Never does `` Lilo & Stitch '' reach the emotion or timelessness of Disney 's great past , or even that of more recent successes such as `` Mulan '' or `` Tarzan . ''	neg
6317	One of those so-so films that could have been much better .	neg
6318	Crossroads feels like a teenybopper Ed Wood film , replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the high-strung but flaccid drama .	neg
6319	Fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor .	neg
6320	Interview With the Assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its Blair Witch Project real-time roots .	neg
6321	Cacoyannis ' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts .	neg
6322	It has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline .	neg
6323	It appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept .	neg
6325	It 's not helpful to listen to extremist name-calling , regardless of whether you think Kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter .	neg
6326	Abandon spends 90 minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed .	neg
6327	The only problem is that , by the end , no one in the audience or the film seems to really care .	neg
6328	No Such Thing is sort of a minimalist Beauty and the Beast , but in this case the Beast should definitely get top billing .	pos
6329	Robert John Burke as The Monster horns in and steals the show .	pos
6330	Due to stodgy , soap opera-ish dialogue , the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a TelePrompTer .	neg
6331	( T ) he film is never sure to make a clear point -- even if it seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation .	neg
6332	While it may not add up to the sum of its parts , Holofcener 's film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded , and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often .	pos
6334	Nobody seems to have cared much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last-minute , haphazard theatrical release .	neg
6335	A thoroughly awful movie -- dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy ... a weird amalgam of ` The Thing ' and a geriatric ` Scream . '	neg
6336	... another example of how Sandler is losing his touch .	neg
6337	Nothing sticks , really , except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams .	neg
6338	What goes on for the 110 minutes of `` Panic Room '' is a battle of witlessness between a not-so-bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals .	neg
6339	The plot 's contrivances are uncomfortably strained .	neg
6340	Guilty of the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this : it 's not scary in the slightest .	neg
6341	Schnieder bounces around with limp wrists , wearing tight tummy tops and hip huggers , twirling his hair on his finger and assuming that 's enough to sustain laughs ...	neg
6342	Its simplicity puts an exclamation point on the fact that this is n't something to be taken seriously , but it also wrecks any chance of the movie rising above similar fare .	neg
6343	By the final whistle you 're convinced that this Mean Machine was a decent TV outing that just does n't have big screen magic .	neg
6344	To say that this vapid vehicle is downright doltish and uneventful is just as obvious as telling a country skunk that he has severe body odor .	neg
6345	A film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun .	neg
6346	Pretend it 's a werewolf itself by avoiding eye contact and walking slowly away .	neg
6347	It 's fun , but it 's a real howler .	pos
6348	Some fine acting , but ultimately a movie with no reason for being .	neg
6349	It 's difficult to feel anything much while watching this movie , beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting .	neg
6350	A waterlogged version of ` Fatal Attraction ' for the teeny-bopper set ... a sad , soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads .	neg
6352	Sweet gentle Jesus , did the screenwriters just do a cut-and-paste of every bad action-movie line in history ?	neg
6354	This is for the most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm .	neg
6355	A loud , witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the TV series .	neg
6356	Even on its own ludicrous terms , The Sum of All Fears generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the Ryan series .	neg
6358	As predictable as the outcome of a Globetrotters-Generals game , Juwanna Mann is even more ludicrous than you 'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved .	neg
6360	Where Tom Green stages his gags as assaults on America 's knee-jerk moral sanctimony , Jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval .	neg
6362	The April 2002 instalment of the American War for Independence , complete with loads of CGI and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood .	neg
6363	Contains all the substance of a Twinkie -- easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing .	neg
6364	Return to Neverland manages to straddle the line between another classic for the company and just another run-of-the-mill Disney sequel intended for the home video market .	neg
6365	Rarely does a film so graceless and devoid of merit as this one come along .	neg
6366	It 's a thin notion , repetitively stretched out to feature length , awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects , droning house music and flat , flat dialogue .	neg
6368	The colorful Masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of Ganesh 's rise up the social ladder .	neg
6369	... an incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud that feels all too familiar .	neg
6370	Wimps out by going for that PG-13 rating , so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen and the sexuality is muted .	neg
6371	Trapped presents a frightening and compelling ` What if ? '	pos
6373	Madonna has made herself over so often now , there 's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like Michael Jackson 's nose .	neg
6374	Never having seen the first two films in the series , I ca n't compare Friday After Next to them , but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days .	neg
6375	The story is lacking any real emotional impact , and the plot is both contrived and cliched .	neg
6376	A depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery .	neg
6377	It 's a bad action movie because there 's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring .	neg
6378	( Soderbergh ) tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience 's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness .	neg
6380	So aggressively cheery that Pollyana would reach for a barf bag .	neg
6381	Scooby-Doo does n't know if it wants to be a retro-refitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly , Nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick .	neg
6382	Russell lacks the visual panache , the comic touch , and perhaps the budget of Sommers 's title-bout features .	neg
6383	Highly uneven and inconsistent ... Margarita Happy Hour kinda resembles the el cheapo margaritas served within .	neg
6384	Very stupid and annoying .	neg
6385	The Sum of All Fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it 's really nothing more than warmed-over Cold War paranoia .	neg
6386	A listless and desultory affair .	neg
6387	Represents the depths to which the girls-behaving-badly film has fallen .	neg
6388	How inept is Serving Sara ?	neg
6389	It makes even Elizabeth Hurley seem graceless and ugly .	neg
6394	Helmer Hudlin tries to make a hip comedy , but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome .	neg
6395	Lazy , miserable and smug .	neg
6396	This is one of the biggest disappointments of the year .	neg
6398	Every visual joke is milked , every set-up obvious and lengthy , every punchline predictable .	neg
6399	There 's no energy .	neg
6402	This is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like Them !	neg
6403	At three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue .	neg
6407	If you recognize Zeus ( the dog from Snatch ) it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one .	neg
6408	This is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , ` Ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie . '	neg
6411	There 's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man 's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present .	neg
6412	It 's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness .	pos
6413	All the sensuality , all the eroticism of a good vampire tale has been , pardon the pun , sucked out and replaced by goth goofiness .	neg
6414	A cross between Blow and Boyz N The Hood , this movie strives to be more , but does n't quite get there .	neg
6415	Good performances keep it from being a total rehash .	pos
6416	The screenplay is hugely overwritten , with tons and tons of dialogue -- most of it given to children .	neg
6418	At times , the movie looks genuinely pretty .	pos
6420	Not even Felinni would know what to make of this Italian freakshow .	neg
6424	It 's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in Slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny .	neg
6425	Despite its promising cast of characters , Big Trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that ` zany ' does n't necessarily mean ` funny . '	neg
6426	Both shrill and soporific , and because everything is repeated five or six times , it can seem tiresomely simpleminded .	neg
6427	Does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny .	neg
6428	Neither revelatory nor truly edgy -- merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored .	neg
6429	Just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting .	neg
6431	Fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur .	neg
6432	There 's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film 's simple title .	neg
6434	A preposterous , prurient whodunit .	neg
6435	Go , girls , right down the reality drain .	neg
6436	Boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory , Impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie .	neg
6437	Can be classified as one of those ` alternate reality ' movies ... except that it would have worked so much better dealing in only one reality .	neg
6438	Predictable and cloying , though Brown Sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle .	pos
6439	... unlikable , uninteresting , unfunny , and completely , utterly inept .	neg
6440	The film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own .	neg
6441	An imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie .	neg
6442	Muddled , melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for Kevin Costner .	neg
6443	Too clumsy in key moments ... to make a big splash .	neg
6444	Just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that 's neither original nor terribly funny .	neg
6445	` Matrix ' - style massacres erupt throughout ... but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with Kafka-inspired philosophy .	neg
6446	At least it 's a fairly impressive debut from the director , Charles Stone III .	pos
6447	It all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense .	neg
6449	Run for your lives !	neg
6450	Why would anyone cast the magnificent Jackie Chan in a movie full of stunt doubles and special effects ?	neg
6451	A grating , emaciated flick .	neg
6452	Unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook .	neg
6454	We have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat .	neg
6455	According to the script , Grant and Bullock 's characters are made for each other .	pos
6458	Ararat feels like a book report	neg
6459	Steve Oedekerk is , alas , no Woody Allen .	neg
6460	A lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless .	neg
6462	The acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing .	neg
6463	Shows that Jackie Chan is getting older , and that 's something I would rather live in denial about	neg
6466	The slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat .	neg
6467	This is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks .	neg
6468	The problem with the mayhem in Formula 51 is not that it 's offensive , but that it 's boring .	neg
6469	Much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome cliché .	neg
6470	the film never rises above a conventional , two dimension tale	neg
6472	Told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject .	neg
6473	The irony is that this film 's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own .	pos
6475	If ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter , this is it .	pos
6476	If ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it .	neg
6477	With an unusual protagonist ( a kilt-wearing Jackson ) and subject matter , the improbable `` Formula 51 '' is somewhat entertaining , but it could have been much stronger .	pos
6479	A feel-good movie that does n't give you enough to feel good about .	neg
6480	Adolescents will be adequately served by the movie 's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a ` topless tutorial service . '	pos
6481	This mistaken-identity picture is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost .	neg
6482	The picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment .	neg
6484	You 'll cry for your money back .	neg
6485	Slap me , I saw this movie .	neg
6486	( The kid 's ) just too bratty for sympathy , and as the film grows to its finale , his little changes ring hollow .	neg
6487	Behind the glitz , Hollywood is sordid and disgusting .	neg
6489	Scherfig , who has had a successful career in TV , tackles more than she can handle .	neg
6490	Just consider what New Best Friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay .	neg
6491	Oscar caliber cast does n't live up to material	neg
6493	They just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way .	neg
6494	Carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , Chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , ` If I stay positive , maybe I can channel one of my greatest pictures , Drunken Master . '	neg
6495	So putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film .	neg
6496	In the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about Kennedy 's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate .	neg
6497	Starts out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into clichés .	neg
6498	Sometimes makes less sense than the Bruckheimeresque American action flicks it emulates .	neg
6499	One of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids , children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation .	neg
6500	There 's only one way to kill Michael Myers for good : stop buying tickets to these movies .	neg
6502	The movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive .	neg
6504	In other words , about as bad a film you 're likely to see all year .	neg
6505	Five screenwriters are credited with the cliché-laden screenplay ; it seems as if each watered down the version of the one before .	neg
6506	The whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of Bewitched that takes place during Spring Break .	neg
6507	Well made but uninvolving , Bloodwork is n't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery .	neg
6508	So we got Ten Little Indians meets Friday the 13th by way of Clean and Sober , filmed on the set of Carpenter 's The Thing and loaded with actors you 're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of The Love Boat .	neg
6509	The movie 's blatant derivativeness is one reason it 's so lackluster .	neg
6510	Kids do n't mind crappy movies as much as adults , provided there 's lots of cute animals and clumsy people .	neg
6514	It 's the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who does n't think about percentages all day long .	neg
6515	Ken Russell would love this .	pos
6516	In one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of Quentin Tarantino 's climactic shootout -- and Meat Loaf explodes .	neg
6518	This is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer .	neg
6519	The premise of `` Abandon '' holds promise , ... but its delivery is a complete mess .	neg
6521	A little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , Monsoon Wedding serves mostly to whet one 's appetite for the Bollywood films .	neg
6522	Unless Bob Crane is someone of particular interest to you , this film 's impressive performances and adept direction are n't likely to leave a lasting impression .	neg
6524	The bottom line with Nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series : Fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , and the uncommitted need n't waste their time on it .	pos
6525	The lousy John Q all but spits out Denzel Washington 's fine performance in the title role .	neg
6526	The whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas .	neg
6527	What a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is !	neg
6528	The film is so packed with subplots involving the various Silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a TV series than a feature film .	neg
6529	Opera on film is never satisfactory .	neg
6530	The art demands live viewing .	pos
6531	The innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen .	neg
6532	Despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless .	neg
6533	It is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill	neg
6534	The Sweetest Thing leaves an awful sour taste .	neg
6535	It 's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay .	neg
6536	Terminally bland , painfully slow and needlessly confusing ... The movie , shot on digital videotape rather than film , is frequently indecipherable .	neg
6537	As dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost Shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy .	pos
6538	Aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships .	neg
6539	A low-rent retread of the Alien pictures .	neg
6541	Its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche .	neg
6542	A big meal of cliches that the talented cast generally chokes on .	neg
6543	The story has little wit and no surprises .	neg
6544	The Merchant-Ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema , only now it 's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage .	neg
6545	What should have been a cutting Hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week 's issue of Variety .	neg
6546	Hey everybody , wanna watch a movie in which a guy dressed as a children 's party clown gets violently gang-raped ?	neg
6548	A little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt .	neg
6549	( T ) his slop does n't even have potential as a cult film , as it 's too loud to shout insults at the screen .	neg
6550	The movie 's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh .	neg
6551	... may work as an addictive guilty pleasure but the material never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence .	neg
6553	as in aimless , arduous , and arbitrary .	neg
6554	Plays like a glossy melodrama that occasionally verges on camp .	neg
6557	A puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks .	neg
6558	Just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making Ararat far more demanding than it needs to be .	neg
6559	A little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium .	neg
6560	There 's a heavy stench of ` been there , done that ' hanging over the film .	neg
6562	The biggest problem with Satin Rouge is Lilia herself .	neg
6564	A quaint , romanticized rendering .	pos
6567	A potentially good comic premise and excellent cast are terribly wasted .	neg
6568	Woody Allen used to ridicule movies like Hollywood Ending .	neg
6572	Been there done that .	neg
6573	There is only so much baked cardboard I need to chew .	neg
6574	A movie like The Guys is why film criticism can be considered work .	neg
6576	Even if it made its original release date last fall , it would 've reeked of a been-there , done-that sameness .	neg
6578	A loud , ugly , irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target .	neg
6579	A movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture .	neg
6580	We can tell what it is supposed to be , but ca n't really call it a work of art .	neg
6582	Bravado Kathy !	pos
6583	... Liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character 's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario .	neg
6584	Too bad .	neg
6587	Unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the Reginald Hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs .	neg
6589	This romantic/comedy asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in .	neg
6590	Squandering his opportunity to make absurdist observations , Burns gets caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare .	neg
6593	It has no affect on the Kurds , but it wore me down .	neg
6594	The actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen .	neg
6595	Co-writer/director Jonathan Parker 's attempts to fashion a Brazil-like , hyper-real satire fall dreadfully short .	neg
6597	A superfluous sequel ... plagued by that old familiar feeling of ` let 's get this thing over with ' : Everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find .	neg
6598	If there 's a heaven for bad movies , Deuces Wild is on its way .	neg
6599	Comes off like a bad imitation of the Bard .	neg
6600	What 's missing in Murder by Numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens ' deviant behaviour .	neg
6602	An uninspired preachy and clichéd war film .	neg
6603	Horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it is n't incomprehensible .	neg
6604	A movie that harps on media-constructed ` issues ' like whether compromise is the death of self ... this Orgasm ( wo n't be an ) exceedingly memorable one for most people .	neg
6606	If Festival in Cannes nails hard - boiled Hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing .	neg
6607	The movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value .	neg
6608	I have n't seen such self-amused trash since Freddy Got Fingered .	neg
6609	Little more than a well-mounted history lesson .	neg
6610	Rob Schneider 's infantile cross-dressing routines fill The Hot Chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian .	neg
6611	A horrible , 99-minute stink bomb .	neg
6612	The film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil .	neg
6613	The film is so bad it does n't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen .	neg
6614	Sheridan 's take on the author 's schoolboy memoir ... is a rather toothless take on a hard young life .	neg
6615	It jumps around with little logic or continuity , presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular , anciently demanding métier .	neg
6617	When it comes to the battle of Hollywood vs. Woo , it looks like Woo 's a P.O.W.	neg
6619	The Chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film .	neg
6620	It 's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast .	neg
6621	The mushy finale turns John Q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker .	pos
6622	Content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance .	neg
6623	The movie turns out to be ( Assayas ' ) homage to the Gallic ` tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness .	neg
6624	Its message has merit and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like Prophet Jack , might have made a point or two regarding life .	neg
6625	( Seems ) even more uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels .	neg
6626	It 's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread .	neg
6627	Neither as scary-funny as Tremors nor demented-funny as Starship Troopers , the movie is n't tough to take as long as you 've paid a matinee price .	neg
6628	If swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh .	neg
6630	The Master of Disguise may have made a great Saturday Night Live sketch , but a great movie it is not .	neg
6631	It 's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the Cannes Film Festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere .	neg
6632	Boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect .	neg
6633	It 's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic .	neg
6634	Unfortunately , that 's precisely what Arthur Dong 's Family Fundamentals does .	neg
6636	Like a medium-grade network sitcom -- mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen .	neg
6637	Something must have been lost in the translation .	neg
6638	Becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any Plympton film : boring .	neg
6639	In the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we 're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses .	neg
6640	Chan 's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there 's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy .	neg
6641	Rock 's stand-up magic wanes .	neg
6642	Hopkins , squarely fills the screen .	pos
6643	Action - mechanical .	neg
6645	Alas , it 's the man that makes the clothes .	pos
6646	For casual moviegoers who stumble into Rules expecting a slice of American Pie hijinks starring the kid from Dawson 's Creek , they 'll probably run out screaming .	neg
6647	The biggest problem I have ( other than the very sluggish pace ) is we never really see her Esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing .	neg
6649	Plot , characters , drama , emotions , ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing The Scorpion King .	neg
6650	City by the Sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for .	pos
6651	But how it washed out despite all of that is the project 's prime mystery .	neg
6652	Whatever the movie 's sentimental , hypocritical lessons about sexism , its true colors come out in various wet T-shirt and shower scenes .	neg
6655	I enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was .	pos
6656	What a pity ... that the material is so second-rate .	neg
6657	Does n't deliver a great story , nor is the action as gripping as in past Seagal films .	neg
6658	The kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea .	neg
6659	Nicks refuses to let Slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy .	pos
6660	Nothing about the film -- with the possible exception of Elizabeth Hurley 's breasts -- is authentic .	neg
6662	Mostly , Shafer and co-writer Gregory Hinton lack a strong-minded viewpoint , or a sense of humor .	neg
6663	No cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces Wild .	neg
6664	Eddie Murphy and Owen Wilson have a cute partnership in I Spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm does n't do a load of good .	neg
6665	Strictly a ` guy 's film ' in the worst sense of the expression .	neg
6666	There 's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes .	neg
6667	It 's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as Phoenix 's .	neg
6668	There 's something fishy about a seasonal holiday kids ' movie ... that derives its moment of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where Santa gives gifts to grownups .	neg
6669	We 're left with a story that tries to grab us , only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments .	neg
6670	Like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories .	neg
6671	There is nothing redeeming about this movie .	neg
6672	The film has ( its ) moments , but they are few and far between .	neg
6673	I was trying to decide what annoyed me most about God is Great ... I 'm Not , and then I realized that I just did n't care .	neg
6674	Derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone .	neg
6676	... comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental .	neg
6677	Brosnan 's finest non-Bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film 's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes .	neg
6678	A film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , Waiting for Happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact .	pos
6679	To me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy .	neg
6681	Flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they ca n't distract from the flawed support structure holding Equilibrium up .	neg
6682	ZigZag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted .	neg
6683	How can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing ?	neg
6684	In truth , it has all the heart of a porno flick ( but none of the sheer lust ) .	neg
6685	Nicks and Steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that 's giving it the old college try .	neg
6686	Episode II -- Attack of the Clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight .	neg
6687	The problem with all of this : It 's not really funny .	neg
6688	( Denis ' ) bare-bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a '70s exploitation picture than the finished product .	neg
6689	Wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from Lynch , Jeunet , and von Trier while failing to find a spark of its own .	neg
6691	Overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste .	neg
6692	The mantra behind the project seems to have been ` it 's just a kids ' flick . '	neg
6693	Translation : ` We do n't need to try very hard . '	neg
6694	In all the annals of the movies , few films have been this odd , inexplicable and unpleasant .	neg
6695	It takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what TUCK EVERLASTING is about .	neg
6697	an essentially awkward version of the lightweight female empowerment picture we 've been watching for decades	neg
6698	The author 's devotees will probably find it fascinating ; others may find it baffling .	neg
6699	Writer-director Walter Hill and co-writer David Giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags .	neg
6700	There 's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : Mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces .	neg
6701	A cockeyed shot all the way .	neg
6702	Lush and beautifully photographed ( somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book ) , but ultimately you 'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered .	neg
6703	Unfortunately , One Hour Photo lives down to its title .	neg
6704	Thanks largely to Williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film .	neg
6705	Cold , Sterile And Lacking Any Color Or Warmth .	neg
6706	The film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold .	neg
6707	Seems like someone going through the motions .	neg
6708	For a film about explosions and death and spies , `` Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever '' seems as safe as a children 's film .	neg
6709	Well , in some of those , the mother deer even dies .	neg
6713	Choppy , overlong documentary about ` The Lifestyle . '	neg
6714	One sloughs one 's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot .	neg
6715	A film which presses familiar Herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised .	neg
6717	brought to life on the big screen .	pos
6718	The story itself is actually quite vapid .	neg
6719	It 's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it does n't offer any insights that have n't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the Dahmer heyday of the mid - '90s .	neg
6721	A few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and Jordan Brady 's direction is prosaic .	neg
6722	Each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top .	neg
6723	Would 've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film 's predictable denouement .	neg
6726	Nair just does n't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy .	neg
6727	Enthusiastically taking up the current teen movie concern with bodily functions , Walt Becker 's film pushes all the demographically appropriate comic buttons .	pos
6728	It 's the funniest American comedy since Graffiti Bridge .	pos
6729	That neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks .	neg
6730	What starts off as a possible Argentine American Beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers .	neg
6731	The project 's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger Fatal Attraction into a high school setting .	neg
6732	In old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , Ms. Shreve 's novel proved too difficult a text to ` lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast .	neg
6733	Solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke	neg
6734	Stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little **** .	neg
6735	No cute factor here ... Not that I mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise .	neg
6736	Deep down , I realized the harsh reality of my situation : I would leave the theater with a lower I.Q. than when I had entered .	neg
6738	Aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom.com or the improperly hammy performance from poor Stephen Rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand .	neg
6739	It is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment .	neg
6740	For its 100 minutes running time , you 'll wait in vain for a movie to happen .	neg
6741	A work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse .	neg
6742	A faster paced family flick .	pos
6743	Upper Teens may get cynical .	neg
6744	Smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy .	pos
6745	While this film has an ` A ' list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale -- like its central figure , Vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love .	neg
6746	It 's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns .	neg
6747	Most fish stories are a little peculiar , but this is one that should be thrown back in the river .	neg
6750	The movie is about as deep as that sentiment .	neg
6752	I 've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but Lil Bow Wow takes the cake .	neg
6753	By halfway through this picture I was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it ... Then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop .	pos
6756	made Eddie Murphy a movie star and the man has n't aged a day .	pos
6759	But it was n't .	neg
6760	For a film about action , Ultimate X is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype .	neg
6761	... a low rate Annie featuring some kid who ca n't act , only echoes of Jordan , and weirdo actor Crispin Glover screwing things up old school .	neg
6762	It might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the Saturday morning cartoons -- a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness .	neg
6763	The picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male All About Eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the Intermezzo strain .	neg
6764	A nearly 21/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent .	neg
6765	Gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid ... a curiously constricted epic .	neg
6767	With a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , Personal Velocity seems to be idling in neutral .	neg
6768	Does n't really add up to much .	neg
6769	It 's better suited for the history or biography channel , but there 's no arguing the tone of the movie - it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind .	neg
6770	An entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots .	neg
6771	A prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp .	neg
6772	Borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion .	neg
6773	It 's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction .	neg
6774	A chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece ... so dull that its tagline should be : ` In space , no one can hear you snore . '	neg
6775	The characters seem one-dimensional , and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience .	neg
6776	Sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor Hermocrates and Leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours .	neg
6777	It 's like a drive-by .	neg
6778	You can drive right by it without noticing anything special , save for a few comic turns , intended and otherwise .	neg
6779	Everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized .	neg
6780	This would-be ` James Bond for the Extreme Generation ' pic is one big , dumb action movie .	neg
6781	Stress ` dumb . '	neg
6783	When your subject is illusion versus reality , should n't the reality seem at least passably real ?	neg
6784	It 's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch .	neg
6785	This is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea ( or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really ) in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question ` Why ? '	neg
6786	A fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down .	neg
6787	Too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style .	neg
6788	There 's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age/coming-out tale .	neg
6789	As much as I laughed throughout the movie , I can not mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys ' superhuman capacity to withstand pain .	pos
6790	The type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the ( teen comedy ) genre a bad name .	neg
6791	Distinctly sub-par ... more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine .	neg
6792	Plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of TV 's Dawson 's Creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of Love Story .	neg
6793	Unless you come in to the film with a skateboard under your arm , you 're going to feel like you were n't invited to the party .	neg
6794	When the casting call for this movie went out , it must have read ` seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame . '	neg
6795	Just is n't as weird as it ought to be .	neg
6796	A `` Home Alone '' film that is staged like `` Rosemary 's Baby , '' but is not as well-conceived as either of those films .	neg
6797	( Siegel ) and co-writers Lisa Bazadona and Grace Woodard have relied too much on convention in creating the characters who surround Frankie .	neg
6798	No film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population .	neg
6802	A sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women .	neg
6803	A low-budget affair , Tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction .	neg
6804	Then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed .	neg
6806	The movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the `` webcast . ''	neg
6807	tale will be all too familiar for anyone who 's seen George Roy Hill 's 1973 film , `` The Sting . ''	neg
6808	Gets the look and the period trappings right , but it otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clichés .	neg
6809	It 's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles , but Notorious C.H.O. still feels like a promising work-in-progress .	pos
6810	Anyone who wants to start writing screenplays can just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity .	neg
6811	The problem with The Bread , My Sweet is that it 's far too sentimental .	neg
6814	Never inspires more than an interested detachment .	neg
6815	What might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of Woody Allen or Mel Brooks ( at least during their '70s heyday ) comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature .	neg
6816	Despite slick production values and director Roger Michell 's tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours .	neg
6817	Pretty much sucks , but has a funny moment or two .	neg
6819	A supernatural mystery that does n't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama .	neg
6820	It ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors .	neg
6821	Two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity .	neg
6823	These are textbook lives of quiet desperation .	neg
6825	Claims to sort the bad guys from the good , which is its essential problem .	neg
6826	Purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons .	neg
6827	Feels like pieces a bunch of other , better movies slapped together .	neg
6829	Writer-director Randall Wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic .	neg
6830	It follows the Blair Witch formula for an hour , in which we 're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes .	neg
6831	One ca n't shake the feeling that Crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for Britney 's latest album .	neg
6832	Phoned-in business as usual .	neg
6834	What little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting , macabre sets , and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else .	neg
6836	Tartakovsky 's team has some freakish powers of visual charm , but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality .	neg
6837	The most horrific movie experience I 've had since `` Ca n't Stop The Music . ''	neg
6838	It may as well be called `` Jar-Jar Binks : The Movie . ''	neg
6839	It 's that painful .	neg
6841	Like a three-ring circus , there are side stories aplenty -- none of them memorable .	neg
6844	A ` Girls Gone Wild ' video for the boho art-house crowd , The Burning Sensation is n't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers are n't removed and inquisitive enough for that .	neg
6845	As original and insightful as last week 's episode of Behind the Music .	neg
6846	Plays like John Le Carré with a couple of burnt-out cylinders .	neg
6847	You may be galled that you 've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie .	neg
6848	It 's neither as sappy as Big Daddy nor as anarchic as Happy Gilmore or The Waterboy , but it has its moments .	pos
6849	Despite the surface attractions -- Conrad L. Hall 's cinematography will likely be nominated for an Oscar next year -- there 's something impressive and yet lacking about everything .	pos
6850	A smug and convoluted action-comedy that does n't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it 's only a movie .	neg
6852	Worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames .	neg
6853	The Christ allegory does n't work because there is no foundation for it	neg
6855	It 's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress .	neg
6856	Tries too hard to be funny in a way that 's too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span .	neg
6857	I did n't find much fascination in the swinging .	neg
6858	What they 're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge .	neg
6859	But that they are doing it is thought-provoking .	pos
6860	The acting is just fine , but there 's not enough substance here to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes , especially with the weak payoff .	neg
6861	After Collateral Damage , you might imagine that most every aggrieved father cliché has been unturned .	neg
6862	But no. .	neg
6863	Ultimately the , yes , snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary , like some sort of Martha Stewart decorating program run amok .	neg
6864	Releasing a film with the word ` dog ' in its title in January lends itself to easy jokes and insults , and Snow Dogs deserves every single one of them .	neg
6865	Tedious Norwegian offering which somehow snagged an Oscar nomination .	neg
6867	A dark-as-pitch comedy that frequently veers into corny sentimentality , probably would not improve much after a therapeutic zap of shock treatment .	neg
6869	Bray is completely at sea ; with nothing but a Savage Garden music video on his resume , he has no clue about making a movie .	neg
6871	a huge disappointment coming , as it does , from filmmakers and performers of this calibre	neg
6872	Though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it 's exploitive without being insightful .	neg
6874	What starts off as a satisfying kids flck becomes increasingly implausible as it races through contrived plot points .	neg
6875	Exhibits the shallow sensationalism characteristic of soap opera ... more salacious telenovela than serious drama .	neg
6876	Seagal is painfully foolish in trying to hold onto what 's left of his passe ' chopsocky glory .	neg
6878	The story is bogus and its characters tissue-thin .	neg
6880	is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche .	neg
6881	While American Adobo has its heart ( and its palate ) in the right place , its brain is a little scattered -- ditsy , even .	neg
6882	Imagine a film that begins as a Seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of The Shining , The Thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s .	neg
6883	Most of the dialogue made me want to pack raw dough in my ears .	neg
6884	Costner 's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as Shadyac 's perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink Laurence Olivier .	neg
6885	It 's coherent , well shot , and tartly acted , but it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate .	neg
6886	Directed by Kevin Bray , whose crisp framing , edgy camera work , and wholesale ineptitude with acting , tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut .	pos
6887	turns a potentially interesting idea into an excruciating film school experience that plays better only for the film 's publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film 's characters	neg
6889	High Crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor , a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd .	neg
6890	Set in a 1986 Harlem that does n't look much like anywhere in New York .	neg
6891	The chocolate factory without Charlie .	neg
6892	Long on twinkly-eyed close-ups and short on shame .	neg
6893	Hip-hop rarely comes alive as its own fire-breathing entity in this picture .	neg
6894	A dull , somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise .	neg
6895	Deserving of its critical backlash and more .	neg
6897	Still , it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered .	neg
6898	The Sum of All Fears is remarkably fuddled about motives and context , which drains it of the dramatic substance that would shake us in our boots ( or cinema seats ) .	neg
6899	The movie spends more time with Schneider than with newcomer McAdams , even though her performance is more interesting ( and funnier ) than his .	neg
6900	This low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the Farrelly brothers ' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time .	neg
6901	It recycles every cliché about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera .	neg
6903	May offend viewers not amused by the sick sense of humor .	neg
6905	It aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one .	neg
6907	If you 're not fans of the adventues of Steve and Terri , you should avoid this like the dreaded King Brown snake .	neg
6908	Personally , I 'd rather watch them on the Animal Planet .	neg
6909	Cherish is a dud -- a romantic comedy that 's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny .	neg
6911	All of the filmmakers ' calculations ca n't rescue Brown Sugar from the curse of blandness .	neg
6913	... post-September 11 , `` The Sum Of All Fears '' seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves .	neg
6914	The exclamation point seems to be the only bit of glee you 'll find in this dreary mess .	neg
6916	Godard 's ode to tackling life 's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess ... In Praise of Love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that 's unfocused and tediously exasperating .	neg
6917	Humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention .	neg
6918	The movie 's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase ` fatal script error . '	neg
6919	Solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say , but he is n't talking a talk that appeals to me .	neg
6920	More tiring than anything .	neg
6921	Nelson 's intentions are good , but the end result does no justice to the story itself .	neg
6922	It 's horribly depressing and not very well done .	neg
6923	... the efforts of its star , Kline , to lend some dignity to a dumb story are for naught .	neg
6924	A good-natured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast , but never quite gets off the ground .	neg
6925	Is n't it a bit early in his career for director Barry Sonnenfeld to do a homage to himself ?	neg
6926	And it 's a lousy one at that .	neg
6927	Overly long and worshipful bio-doc .	neg
6928	I 'll go out on a limb .	pos
6929	It is n't quite one of the worst movies of the year .	neg
6930	It 's just merely very bad .	neg
6931	Writer-director Ritchie reduces Wertmuller 's social mores and politics to tiresome jargon .	neg
6933	Everything about Girls Ca n't Swim , even its passages of sensitive observation , feels secondhand , familiar -- and not in a good way .	neg
6934	Feels aimless for much of its running time , until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives , leaving questions in its wake .	neg
6935	In my own very humble opinion , In Praise of Love lacks even the most fragmented charms I have found in almost all of his previous works .	neg
6936	The script is too mainstream and the psychology too textbook to intrigue .	neg
6937	Muddled , simplistic and more than a little pretentious .	neg
6939	A disaster of a drama , saved only by its winged assailants .	neg
6941	Director Elie Chouraqui , who co-wrote the script , catches the chaotic horror of war , but why bother if you 're going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera ?	neg
6942	Dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he 's dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation .	neg
6943	If there was any doubt that Peter O'Fallon did n't have an original bone in his body , A Rumor of Angels should dispel it .	neg
6944	An occasionally interesting but mostly repetitive look at a slice of counterculture that might be best forgotten .	neg
6945	What could have been right at home as a nifty plot line in Steven Soderbergh 's Traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination .	neg
6946	The movie is like Scorsese 's Mean Streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old ` juvenile delinquent ' paperbacks with titles like Leather Warriors and Switchblade Sexpot .	neg
6947	This pathetic junk is barely an hour long .	neg
6948	Nevertheless , it still seems endless .	neg
6949	It is n't that Stealing Harvard is a horrible movie -- if only it were that grand a failure !	neg
6950	It 's just that it 's so not-at-all-good .	neg
6953	Is it possible for a documentary to be utterly entranced by its subject and still show virtually no understanding of it ?	neg
6954	It 's supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much Norma Rae and not enough Pretty Woman .	neg
6955	The leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer 's secondhand material .	neg
6956	Staggers between flaccid satire and what is supposed to be madcap farce .	neg
6957	Not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired .	neg
6959	Plays like the old disease-of-the-week small-screen melodramas .	neg
6960	Like life on the island , the movie grows boring despite the scenery .	neg
6961	The truth about Charlie is that it 's a brazenly misguided project .	neg
6963	So exaggerated and broad that it comes off as annoying rather than charming .	neg
6964	An awkward hybrid of genres that just does n't work .	neg
6965	The latest vapid actor 's exercise to appropriate the structure of Arthur Schnitzler 's Reigen .	neg
6966	Snipes is both a snore and utter tripe .	neg
6967	Ritchie 's film is easier to swallow than Wertmuller 's polemical allegory , but it 's self-defeatingly decorous .	neg
6968	Chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly .	neg
6969	It 's the kind of under-inspired , overblown enterprise that gives Hollywood sequels a bad name .	neg
6970	Rosenthal ( Halloween II ) seems to have forgotten everything he ever knew about generating suspense .	neg
6971	Even Murphy 's expert comic timing and famed charisma ca n't rescue this effort .	neg
6973	A sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions .	neg
6974	Some Body smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling .	neg
6976	Apparently , romantic comedy with a fresh point of view just does n't figure in the present Hollywood program .	neg
6977	Depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived .	neg
6978	Only masochistic moviegoers need apply .	neg
6979	A movie that 's held captive by mediocrity .	neg
6982	What 's next ?	pos
6984	David Spade as Citizen Kane ?	neg
6986	The problem , amazingly enough , is the screenplay .	neg
6987	It 's a Frankenstein-monster of a film that does n't know what it wants to be .	neg
6988	Upper West Sidey exercise in narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as a tribute .	neg
6989	On its icy face , the new film is a subzero version of Monsters , Inc. , without the latter 's imagination , visual charm or texture .	neg
6990	I ca n't say this enough : This movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies .	neg
6991	It 's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex .	neg
6992	After a while , the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get through The Country Bears is to ponder how a whole segment of pop-music history has been allowed to get wet , fuzzy and sticky .	neg
6995	The film is grossly contradictory in conveying its social message , if indeed there is one .	neg
6996	Often lingers just as long on the irrelevant as on the engaging , which gradually turns What Time Is It There ?	neg
6997	into How Long Is This Movie ?	neg
6998	Too bad Kramer could n't make a guest appearance to liven things up .	neg
6999	Deuces Wild is an encyclopedia of cliches that shoplifts shamelessly from farewell-to-innocence movies like The Wanderers and A Bronx Tale without cribbing any of their intelligence .	neg
7000	It 's a barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground .	neg
7001	Epps has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that has made Tucker a star .	neg
7003	A dull , dumb and derivative horror film .	neg
7004	An awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism .	neg
7005	Demme gets a lot of flavor and spice into his Charade remake , but he ca n't disguise that he 's spiffing up leftovers that are n't so substantial or fresh .	neg
7006	This is a heartfelt story ... it just is n't a very involving one .	neg
7007	These self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation .	neg
7008	The fact that the ` best part ' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of Demme 's good films does n't bode well for the rest of it .	neg
7009	Richard Pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but Lawrence gives us mostly fool 's gold .	neg
7011	... built on the premise that middle-class Arkansas consists of monster truck-loving good ol' boys and peroxide blond honeys whose worldly knowledge comes from TV reruns and supermarket tabloids .	neg
7012	A laughable -- or rather , unlaughable -- excuse for a film .	neg
7014	Like a grinning Jack O ' Lantern , its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded .	neg
7015	A sentimental hybrid that could benefit from the spice of specificity .	pos
7016	... familiar and predictable , and 4/5ths of it might as well have come from a Xerox machine rather than ( writer-director ) Franc .	neg
7018	Give Shapiro , Goldman , and Bolado credit for good intentions , but there 's nothing here that they could n't have done in half an hour .	neg
7019	It 's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even Jason X ... look positively Shakesperean by comparison .	neg
7021	One of the worst films of 2002 .	neg
7023	plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure Hollywood .	neg
7024	McTiernan 's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious .	neg
7025	High Crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government / Marine/legal mystery , and that 's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue .	neg
7026	This movie is about the worst thing Chan has done in the United States .	neg
7027	The explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me .	neg
7028	This ludicrous film is predictable at every turn .	neg
7029	An incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people ... manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy .	neg
7030	The film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility .	neg
7031	Instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the X Games , we get a cinematic postcard that 's superficial and unrealized .	neg
7032	The crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise .	neg
7033	I wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways .	neg
7034	The superior plotline is n't quite enough to drag along the dead ( water ) weight of the other .	neg
7035	The film does n't really care about the thousands of Americans who die hideously , it cares about how Ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the CIA .	neg
7036	Adrift , Bentley and Hudson stare and sniffle , respectively , as Ledger attempts , in vain , to prove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad hair design .	neg
7037	After an hour and a half of wondering -- sometimes amusedly , sometimes impatiently -- just what this strenuously unconventional movie is supposed to be , you discover that the answer is as conventional as can be .	neg
7038	` Linklater fans , or pretentious types who want to appear avant-garde will suck up to this project ... '	neg
7039	A woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite Iwai 's vaunted empathy .	neg
7041	If you really want to understand what this story is really all about , you 're far better served by the source material .	neg
7042	It 's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist ... studiously inoffensive and completely disposable .	neg
7043	Like its title character , Esther Kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating .	neg
7044	The star who helped give a spark to `` Chasing Amy '' and `` Changing Lanes '' falls flat as thinking man CIA agent Jack Ryan in this summer 's new action film , `` The Sum of All Fears . ''	neg
7045	A summary of the plot does n't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution .	neg
7046	Every conceivable mistake a director could make in filming opera has been perpetrated here .	neg
7047	Snoots will no doubt rally to its cause , trotting out threadbare standbys like ` masterpiece ' and ` triumph ' and all that malarkey , but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers ' time with a gobbler like this .	neg
7048	( The film 's ) taste for `` shock humor '' will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of Tom Green and the Farrelly Brothers .	neg
7049	Any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things .	pos
7052	Interminably bleak , to say nothing of boring .	neg
7053	Things really get weird , though not particularly scary : the movie is all portent and no content .	neg
7058	Oh , look at that clever angle !	pos
7060	Demme finally succeeds in diminishing his stature from Oscar-winning master to lowly studio hack .	neg
7061	The action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if Kaos had n't blown them all up .	neg
7062	It almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us .	neg
7063	It puts Washington , as honest working man John Q. Archibald , on a pedestal , then keeps lifting the pedestal higher .	pos
7064	Ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you 're up for that sort of thing .	neg
7065	Far more enjoyable than its predecessor .	pos
7066	( Gayton 's script ) telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience .	pos
7067	Full Frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre 's definitive , if disingenuous , feature .	neg
7068	A ragbag of cliches .	neg
7070	The three leads produce adequate performances , but what 's missing from this material is any depth of feeling .	neg
7071	It 's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling .	neg
7072	This painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications ... that have no bearing on the story .	neg
7073	Short and sweet , but also more than anything else slight ... Tadpole pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations .	pos
7075	What more can be expected from a college comedy that 's target audience has n't graduated from junior high school ?	neg
7077	The plan to make Enough into ` an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller ' has flopped as surely as a soufflé gone wrong .	neg
7078	Instead of letting the laughs come as they may , Lawrence unleashes his trademark misogyny -- er , comedy -- like a human volcano or an overflowing septic tank , take your pick .	neg
7080	Just send it to Cranky .	neg
7081	We do n't get paid enough to sit through crap like this .	neg
7082	An even more predictable , cliche-ridden endeavor than its predecessor .	neg
7083	The whole thing plays like a tired Tyco ad .	neg
7084	The film does n't show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the non-fan to figure out what makes Wilco a big deal .	neg
7086	No , I do n't know why Steven Seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money .	neg
7087	Even by the intentionally low standards of frat-boy humor , Sorority Boys is a bowser .	neg
7088	One well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout , but a hundred of them can be numbing .	neg
7090	Halfway through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , Blade II mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary .	neg
7091	Weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting .	neg
7092	We ca n't accuse Kung Pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie .	neg
7093	Unfortunately , we 'd prefer a simple misfire .	neg
7094	There is n't one moment in the film that surprises or delights .	neg
7097	Most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and , no matter how Broomfield dresses it up , it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence .	neg
7098	This movie , a certain scene in particular , brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch .	neg

7106	The lousy lead performances ... keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired .	neg
7107	Its and pieces of The Hot Chick are so hilarious , and Schneider 's performance is so fine , it 's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in The Animal -- is a slapdash mess .	neg
7108	( Creates ) the worst kind of mythologizing , the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama .	neg
7109	The movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates .	neg
7110	Earnest and heartfelt but undernourished and plodding .	pos
7111	A sugar-coated Rocky whose valuable messages are forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone honks .	neg

7114	Has all the complexity and realistic human behavior of an episode of General Hospital .	neg
7115	An acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 , but it 's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to McDonald 's , let alone some savvy street activism .	neg
7117	An exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound .	neg
7118	Not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans .	neg
7119	The movie is silly beyond comprehension , and even if it were n't silly , it would still be beyond comprehension .	neg
7120	Watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when Carol Kane appears on the screen .	neg
7121	The scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film 's characters .	neg
7123	The film has a nearly terminal case of the cutes , and it 's neither as funny nor as charming as it thinks it is .	neg
7124	More a gunfest than a Rock concert .	neg

7129	A listless sci-fi comedy in which Eddie Murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect .	neg
7131	A generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it is n't merely offensive .	neg
7132	Julie Davis is the Kathie Lee Gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego does n't always go hand in hand with talent .	neg
7133	An unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled ` hip ' , ` innovative ' and ` realistic ' .	neg
7134	The story 's pathetic and the gags are puerile . .	neg
7135	Curiously , Super Troopers suffers because it does n't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length .	neg
7136	So bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled Generic Jennifer Lopez Romantic Comedy .	neg
7139	I still want my money back .	neg
7140	It plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its `` dead wife communicating from beyond the grave '' framework is even remotely new or interesting .	neg
7142	All too familiar ... basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when ` Angels With Dirty Faces ' appeared in 1938 .	neg
7145	Although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it 's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out .	neg
7146	After the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichés , depression and bad alternative music .	neg
7147	No one can doubt the filmmakers ' motives , but The Guys still feels counterproductive .	neg
7148	A very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel .	neg
7149	With little visible talent and no energy , Colin Hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee .	neg
7153	Seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product 's unshapely look , director Fisher Stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in Waking Life water colors .	neg
7154	Formula 51 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip .	neg
7155	Everything that was right about Blade is wrong in its sequel .	neg
7157	The film was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Joel Schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one ( and no one ) .	neg
7158	Disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel .	neg
7159	Coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock .	neg
7160	Anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy .	neg
7162	They presume their audience wo n't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes .	neg
7163	Collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence .	neg
7164	The following things are not at all entertaining : The bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching Seinfeld ( who is also one of the film 's producers ) do everything he can to look like a good guy .	neg
7165	Attal 's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare I say , outdated , it 's a wonder that he could n't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident .	neg
7166	Obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque .	neg
7167	The most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters .	neg
7168	Michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet that it 's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously .	neg
7170	Enigma lacks it .	neg
7171	Potty-mouthed enough for PG-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as South Park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults .	neg
7173	A distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour .	neg
7174	Most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement .	neg
7175	In the end , Tuck Everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in .	neg
7176	Rather less than the sum of its underventilated père-fils confrontations .	neg
7177	McKay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative .	neg
7178	Plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line .	neg
7180	Amid the shock and curiosity factors , the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way .	neg
7181	Yes , Spirited Away is a triumph of imagination , but it 's also a failure of storytelling .	neg
7182	A characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie .	neg
7184	Whenever you think you 've seen the end of the movie , we cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end .	neg
7186	You begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain .	neg
7188	The screenplay , co-written by director Imogen Kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing .	neg
7189	The milieu is wholly unconvincing ... and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch .	neg
7190	Unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters .	neg
7191	Each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time .	neg
7194	The laughs are as rare as snake foo yung .	neg
7196	lazily and glumly settles into a most traditional , reserved kind of filmmaking .	neg
7197	Knockaround Guys plays like a student film by two guys who desperately want to be Quentin Tarantino when they grow up .	neg
7198	But they lack their idol 's energy and passion for detail .	neg
7199	Mattei so completely loses himself to the film 's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , Love in the Time of Money .	neg
7201	Holland lets things peter out midway , but it 's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals .	pos
7202	For every articulate player , such as skateboarder Tony Hawk or BMX rider Mat Hoffman , are about a half dozen young Turks angling to see how many times they can work the words `` radical '' or `` suck '' into a sentence .	neg
7203	There 's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale .	neg
7204	An impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle .	neg
7205	It 's unfortunate that Wallace , who wrote Gibson 's Braveheart as well as the recent Pearl Harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue .	neg
7206	I liked the movie , but I know I would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further .	pos
7207	I 'm left slightly disappointed that it did n't .	neg
7208	Dreary tale of middle-class angst	neg
7209	For a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either .	neg
7210	( Jackson and Bledel ) seem to have been picked not for their acting chops , but for their looks and appeal to the pre-teen crowd .	neg
7212	Like Schindler 's List , The Grey Zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way .	neg
7213	An unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the DV revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film .	neg
7215	It 's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey .	neg
7216	Friday After Next is a lot more bluster than bite .	neg
7219	There are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels .	neg
7220	Ice Cube is n't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but Friday After Next spreads them pretty thin .	neg
7222	The characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality .	neg
7224	Just dreadful .	neg
7225	I do n't blame Eddie Murphy but should n't Owen Wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ?	neg
7226	Sweet Home Alabama certainly wo n't be remembered as one of ( Witherspoon 's ) better films .	neg
7227	hard as this may be to believe , Here on Earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film .	neg
7228	This is just lazy writing .	neg
7229	Even kids deserve better .	neg
7230	The pretensions -- and disposable story -- sink the movie .	neg
7231	And Diesel is n't the actor to save it .	neg
7234	Frank Capra played this story straight .	pos
7235	But the 2002 film does n't really believe in it , and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate ` comedy ' scenes .	neg
7237	The problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull .	neg
7238	Handled correctly , Wilde 's play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice .	pos
7239	Here , alas , it collapses like an overcooked soufflé .	neg
7240	`` Sorority Boys '' was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad .	neg
7241	A bizarre piece of work , with premise and dialogue at the level of kids ' television and plot threads as morose as teen pregnancy , rape and suspected murder	neg
7242	Paul Bettany is good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe , but the movie is certainly not number 1 .	neg
7245	Often likable , but just as often it 's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy .	pos
7246	Certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , Eight Crazy Nights is a total misfire .	neg
7247	Elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side .	pos
7248	Showtime is n't particularly assaultive , but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again .	neg
7249	All the characters are clinically depressed and have abandoned their slim hopes and dreams .	neg
7250	This Tuxedo ... should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations .	neg
7252	But first , you have to give the audience a reason to want to put for that effort	neg
7253	Been there , done that ... a thousand times already , and better .	neg
7254	What 's most offensive is n't the waste of a good cast , but the film 's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism .	neg
7255	Sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness .	neg
7256	Fans of Plympton 's shorts may marginally enjoy the film , but it is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers .	neg
7258	None of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of Sorority Boys is as appalling as any ` comedy ' to ever spill from a projector 's lens .	neg
7259	The kind of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics .	neg
7260	` Punch-Drunk Love is so convinced of its own brilliance that , if it were a person , you 'd want to smash its face in . '	neg
7261	At once overly old-fashioned in its sudsy plotting and heavy-handed in its effort to modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance .	neg
7262	The trashy teen-sleaze equivalent of Showgirls .	neg
7263	While the production details are lavish , film has little insight into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how Sand developed a notorious reputation .	neg
7264	A crass and insulting homage to great films like Some Like It Hot and the John Wayne classics .	neg
7267	With all the sympathy , empathy and pity fogging up the screen ... His Secret Life enters the land of unintentional melodrama and tiresome love triangles .	neg
7268	The problematic characters and overly convenient plot twists foul up Shum 's good intentions .	neg
7269	What ` Blade Runner ' would 've looked like as a low-budget series on a UHF channel .	neg
7270	Has all the values of a straight-to-video movie , but because it has a bigger-name cast , it gets a full theatrical release .	neg
7271	With its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , All About the Benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s .	neg
7272	It never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time .	pos
7273	Loud , silly , stupid and pointless .	neg
7275	You 'll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie .	neg
7276	A yawn-provoking little farm melodrama .	neg
7277	Did no one on the set have a sense of humor , or did they not have the nerve to speak up ?	neg
7278	Seriously , rent the Disney version .	neg
7279	As David Letterman and The Onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but Lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them .	neg
7280	Like its parade of predecessors , this Halloween is a gory slash-fest .	pos
7282	`` Abandon '' will leave you wanting to abandon the theater .	neg
7283	Problem is , we have no idea what in creation is going on .	neg
7284	A live-action cartoon , a fast-moving and cheerfully simplistic 88 minutes of exaggerated action put together with the preteen boy in mind .	pos
7285	A loquacious and dreary piece of business .	neg
7286	What the audience feels is exhaustion , from watching a movie that is dark ( dark green , to be exact ) , sour , bloody and mean .	neg
7287	director Hoffman , his writer and Kline 's agent should serve detention	neg
7289	Meticulously mounted , exasperatingly well-behaved film , which ticks off Kahlo 's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant .	pos
7290	Time of Favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation .	neg
7291	I 'm not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on Johnny Knoxville 's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche .	neg
7293	I 'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by Vincent R. Nebrida or the gutless direction by Laurice Guillen .	neg
7294	The only reason you should see this movie is if you have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow .	neg
7296	As with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else .	neg
7297	The Irwins ' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts .	neg
7298	If routine action and jokes like this are your cup of tea , then pay your $ 8 and get ready for the big shear .	neg
7299	This is one baaaaaaaaad movie .	neg
7300	A man leaving the screening said the film was better than Saving Private Ryan .	pos
7302	But Windtalkers does n't beat that one , either .	neg
7303	May puzzle his most ardent fans .	neg
7304	Starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and ends up as a bitter pill .	neg
7305	We never feel anything for these characters , and as a result the film is basically just a curiosity .	neg
7309	Feels like the work of an artist who is simply tired -- of fighting the same fights , of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders , of playing with narrative form .	neg
7310	While you have to admit it 's semi-amusing to watch Robert DeNiro belt out `` When you 're a Jet , you 're a Jet all the way , '' it 's equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to `` Tonight . ''	neg
7311	The whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it 's trying to set the women 's liberation movement back 20 years . '	neg
7312	... the cast portrays their cartoon counterparts well ... but quite frankly , Scoob and Shag do n't eat enough during the film . '	neg
7313	More of the same old garbage Hollywood has been trying to pass off as acceptable teen entertainment for some time now .	neg
7314	TV skit-com material fervently deposited on the big screen .	neg
7315	( Johnnie To and Wai Ka Fai are ) sure to find an enthusiastic audience among American action-adventure buffs , but the film 's interests may be too narrow to attract crossover viewers .	neg
7316	If there was ever a movie where the upbeat ending feels like a copout , this is the one .	neg
7317	It 's as sorry a mess as its director 's diabolical debut , Mad Cows .	neg
7318	Any attempts at nuance given by the capable cast is drowned out by director Jon Purdy 's sledgehammer sap .	neg
7319	Its audacious ambitions sabotaged by pomposity , Steven Soderbergh 's space opera emerges as a numbingly dull experience .	neg
7320	Despite some strong performances , never rises above the level of a telanovela .	neg
7323	Unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications .	neg
7324	Vulgar is too optimistic a title .	neg
7326	The characters never change .	neg
7327	If The Last Man were the last movie left on earth , there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows .	neg
7328	Welles groupie/scholar Peter Bogdanovich took a long time to do it , but he 's finally provided his own broadside at publishing giant William Randolph Hearst .	pos
7329	Makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes , becoming so slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it in the first place .	neg
7330	Even as I valiantly struggled to remain interested , or at least conscious , I could feel my eyelids ... getting ... very ... heavy ...	neg
7331	A bad movie that happened to good actors .	neg
7332	Boasts eye-catching art direction but has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome .	neg
7333	Screenwriter Dan Schneider and director Shawn Levy substitute volume and primary colors for humor and bite .	pos
7334	Oversexed , at times overwrought comedy/drama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty , female and single .	neg
7335	That such a horrible movie could have sprung from such a great one is one of the year 's worst cinematic tragedies .	neg
7336	It all starts to smack of a Hallmark Hall of Fame , with a few four letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television .	neg
7337	Rarely has a film 's title served such dire warning .	neg
7338	If you saw Benigni 's Pinocchio at a public park , you 'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police .	neg
7341	Mr. Wollter and Ms. Seldhal give strong and convincing performances , but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear .	neg
7342	Shafer 's feature does n't offer much in terms of plot or acting .	neg
7343	In his role of observer of the scene , Lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature .	neg
7344	( T ) he ideas of Revolution # 9 are more compelling than the execution	neg
7345	The film did n't convince me that Calvin Jr. 's Barbershop represents some sort of beacon of hope in the middle of Chicago 's South Side .	neg
7346	What happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares ?	neg
7347	Despite some comic sparks , Welcome to Collinwood never catches fire .	neg
7348	Director George Hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place .	neg
7349	Shows moments of promise but ultimately succumbs to cliches and pat storytelling .	neg
7350	Even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency .	neg
7351	Some Body is a shaky , uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves .	pos
7352	All the small moments and flashbacks do n't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition .	neg
7353	( A ) stale retread of the '53 original .	neg
7354	One thing 's for sure -- if George Romero had directed this movie , it would n't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head .	neg
7355	For dance completists only .	neg
7356	Spreads itself too thin , leaving these actors , as well as the members of the commune , short of profound characterizations	neg
7357	It would n't matter so much that this arrogant Richard Pryor wannabe 's routine is offensive , puerile and unimaginatively foul-mouthed if it was at least funny .	neg
7358	The locale ... remains far more interesting than the story at hand .	neg
7360	I liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it 's too long and it goes nowhere .	neg
7361	This little film is so slovenly done , so primitive in technique , that it ca n't really be called animation .	neg
7362	Makes 98 minutes feel like three hours .	neg
7363	Hawke 's film , a boring , pretentious waste of nearly two hours , does n't tell you anything except that the Chelsea Hotel today is populated by whiny , pathetic , starving and untalented artistes .	neg
7364	Aspires to the cracked lunacy of The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai , but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like The Adventures of Ford Fairlane .	neg
7365	Real-life strongman Ahola lacks the charisma and ability to carry the film on his admittedly broad shoulders .	neg
7366	The title , alone , should scare any sane person away .	neg
7367	Low comedy does n't come much lower .	neg
7368	Appropriately cynical social commentary aside , # 9 never quite ignites .	neg
7369	It 's crap on a leash -- far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of Joe Dante 's similarly styled Gremlins .	neg
7370	One of the most depressing movie-going experiences I can think of is to sit through about 90 minutes of a so-called ` comedy ' and not laugh once .	neg
7371	This is the kind of movie where the big scene is a man shot out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream .	neg
7373	A loud , brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy .	neg
7374	An exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as Katzenberg 's The Prince of Egypt from 1998 .	neg
7375	The movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory .	neg
7376	The movie 's vision of a white American zealously spreading a Puritanical brand of Christianity to South Seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish .	neg
7377	Maid in Manhattan proves that it 's easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies .	neg
7378	A fairly harmless but ultimately lifeless feature-length afterschool special .	neg
7380	... the whole thing succeeded only in making me groggy .	neg
7381	Like most of Jaglom 's films , some of it is honestly affecting , but more of it seems contrived and secondhand .	neg
7382	One long , numbing action sequence made up mostly of routine stuff Yuen has given us before .	neg
7383	Forgettable , if good-hearted , movie .	neg
7384	The film 's most improbable feat ?	neg
7386	... about as exciting to watch as two last-place basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season .	neg
7387	The Chateau ... is less concerned with cultural and political issues than doting on its eccentric characters .	neg
7388	Cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment ... simultaneously degrades its characters , its stars and its audience .	neg
7389	It 's not too fast and not too slow .	pos
7391	It 's not too much of anything .	neg
7392	The great pity is that those responsible did n't cut their losses -- and ours -- and retitle it The Adventures of Direct-to-Video Nash , and send it to its proper home .	neg
7394	An empty shell of an epic rather than the real deal .	neg
7396	Instead of using George and Lucy 's most obvious differences to ignite sparks , Lawrence desperately looks elsewhere , seizing on George 's haplessness and Lucy 's personality tics .	neg
7398	Becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that does n't and a thriller that wo n't .	neg
7399	Family togetherness takes a back seat to inter-family rivalry and workplace ambition ... whole subplots have no explanation or even plot relevance .	neg
7400	Grant is n't Cary and Bullock is n't Katherine .	neg
7401	Like a fish that 's lived too long , Austin Powers in Goldmember has some unnecessary parts and is kinda wrong in places .	neg
7402	Two tedious acts light on great scares and a good surprise ending .	pos
7403	Shyamalan should stop trying to please his mom .	neg
7404	The entire movie is in need of a scented bath .	neg
7405	I 'm sorry to say that this should seal the deal - Arnold is not , nor will he be , back .	neg
7406	The story of Trouble Every Day ... is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie 's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult .	neg
7407	A Movie to Forget	neg
7408	For all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2 - hour running time .	neg
7409	Enough is not a bad movie , just mediocre .	neg
7410	The performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody .	neg
7411	It looks good , but it is essentially empty .	neg
7412	The film never finds its tone and several scenes run too long .	neg
7413	The idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of Run Lola Run .	neg
7414	Van Wilder has a built-in audience , but only among those who are drying out from spring break and are still unconcerned about what they ingest .	neg
7415	It 's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby .	neg
7416	Do we really need another film that praises female self-sacrifice ?	neg
7417	The major problem with Windtalkers is that the bulk of the movie centers on the wrong character .	neg
7420	The entire point of a shaggy dog story , of course , is that it goes nowhere , and this is classic nowheresville in every sense .	neg
7421	Stale and clichéd to a fault .	neg
7422	This film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own .	neg
7423	Watching junk like this induces a kind of abstract guilt , as if you were paying dues for good books unread , fine music never heard .	neg
7425	Starts off witty and sophisticated and you want to love it -- but filmmaker Yvan Attal quickly writes himself into a corner .	neg
7426	Some Like It Hot on the Hardwood proves once again that a man in drag is not in and of himself funny .	neg
7428	Witless and utterly pointless .	neg
7429	When ` science fiction ' takes advantage of the fact that its intended audience has n't yet had much science , it does a disservice to the audience and to the genre .	neg
7433	As a feature-length film , it wears out its welcome as tryingly as the title character .	neg
7435	A sleep-inducing thriller with a single twist that everyone except the characters in it can see coming a mile away .	neg
7436	With a `` Spy Kids '' sequel opening next week , why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a `` SNL '' has-been acting like an 8-year-old channeling Roberto Benigni ?	neg
7437	It 's just rather leaden and dull .	neg
7438	Lacks the visual flair and bouncing bravado that characterizes better hip-hop clips and is content to recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago .	neg
7439	Statham employs an accent that I think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass American but sometimes just lapses into unhidden British .	neg
7440	Instead of trying to bust some blondes , ( Diggs ) should be probing why a guy with his talent ended up in a movie this bad .	neg

7588	It lacks the compassion , good-natured humor and the level of insight that made ( Eyre 's ) first film something of a sleeper success .	neg
7590	A sustained fest of self-congratulation between actor and director that leaves scant place for the viewer .	neg

7603	Haneke 's script ( from Elfriede Jelinek 's novel ) is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending .	neg

7621	The densest distillation of Roberts ' movies ever made .	neg
7622	Ultimately , the film never recovers from the clumsy cliché of the ugly American abroad , and the too-frosty exterior Ms. Paltrow employs to authenticate her British persona is another liability .	neg
7623	A handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on PBS than a night out at an AMC .	neg
7626	Master of Disguise runs for only 71 minutes and feels like three hours .	neg

7636	It 's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message , so it 's great for the kids .	pos
7639	Tykwer 's surface flash is n't just a poor fit with Kieslowski 's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything Kieslowski 's work aspired to , including the condition of art .	neg
7641	Too slick and manufactured to claim street credibility .	neg
7642	Cherry Orchard is badly edited , often awkwardly directed and suffers from the addition of a wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a ` back story . '	neg
7643	What ensues are much blood-splattering , mass drug-induced bowel evacuations , and none-too-funny commentary on the cultural distinctions between Americans and Brits .	neg
7644	A dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so .	neg
7645	The movie is without intent .	neg
7647	While Hollywood Ending has its share of belly laughs ( including a knockout of a closing line ) , the movie winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity .	neg

7649	Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip .	neg
7650	Allegiance to Chekhov , which director Michael Cacoyannis displays with somber earnestness in the new adaptation of The Cherry Orchard , is a particularly vexing handicap .	neg
7651	You expect more from director Michael Apted ( Enigma ) and screenwriter Nicholas Kazan ( Reversal of Fortune ) than this cliche pileup .	neg
7652	The first mistake , I suspect , is casting Shatner as a legendary professor and Kunis as a brilliant college student -- where 's Pauly Shore as the rocket scientist ?	neg
7653	The dramatic scenes are frequently unintentionally funny , and the action sequences -- clearly the main event -- are surprisingly uninvolving .	neg
7654	Replacing John Carpenter 's stylish tracking shots is degraded , handheld Blair Witch video-cam footage .	neg
7655	Of all the Halloween 's , this is the most visually unappealing .	neg
7656	It has the requisite faux-urban vibe and hotter-two-years-ago rap and R&B names and references .	neg

7679	Once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funniest idea is n't funny .	neg
7681	The connected stories of Breitbart and Hanussen are actually fascinating , but the filmmaking in Invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice .	neg
7682	A depressingly retrograde , ` post-feminist ' romantic comedy that takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women .	neg
7683	Return to Never Land is much more P.C. than the original version ( no more racist portraits of Indians , for instance ) , but the excitement is missing .	neg

7702	Slap her - she 's not funny !	neg
7703	No French people were harmed during the making of this movie , but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half .	neg

7712	Its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie 's presentation , which is way too stagy .	neg

7777	An ugly , revolting movie .	neg
7778	The film is way too full of itself ; it 's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-Oscar kind of way .	neg

7880	How do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ?	neg
7881	On the evidence before us , the answer is clear : Not easily and , in the end , not well enough .	neg
7882	The film 's trailer also looked like crap , so crap is what I was expecting .	neg
7883	More trifle than triumph .	neg
7884	The movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction .	neg
7885	Festers in just such a dungpile that you 'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you .	neg
7886	Lyne 's latest , the erotic thriller Unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded .	neg
7887	It sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that 's more or less how it plays out .	neg
7888	Rumor , a muddled drama about coming to terms with death , feels impersonal , almost generic .	neg
7889	Report card : Does n't live up to the exalted tagline - there 's definite room for improvement .	neg
7890	Does n't deserve a passing grade ( even on a curve ) .	neg
7891	The pacing is deadly , the narration helps little and Naipaul , a juicy writer , is negated .	neg

7894	... if it had been only half-an-hour long or a TV special , the humor would have been fast and furious -- at ninety minutes , it drags .	neg
7895	Bean drops the ball too many times ... hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay .	neg
7897	Blood Work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from Eastwood 's Dirty Harry period .	neg
7898	The movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications .	neg
7899	( Lee ) treats his audience the same way that Jim Brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects .	neg
7900	And Lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception .	pos
7901	There 's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue .	neg
7902	No amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , and shooting can hide a weak script .	neg
7903	It 's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise .	neg
7904	Nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here .	neg
7906	Earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner .	neg
7907	Ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of Louis Begley 's source novel ( About Schmidt ) and an old Payne screenplay .	neg
7908	The exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors .	pos
7909	We started to wonder if ... some unpaid intern had just typed ` Chris Rock , ' ` Anthony Hopkins ' and ` terrorists ' into some Univac-like script machine .	neg
7910	Even when Crush departs from the 4W formula ... it feels like a glossy rehash .	neg
7911	More likely to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat .	neg
7912	Bears is even worse than I imagined a movie ever could be .	neg
7913	When you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie , you know the picture is in trouble .	neg
7914	This is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives .	neg
7915	Marinated in clichés and mawkish dialogue .	neg
7916	Whether it 's the worst movie of 2002 , I ca n't say for sure : Memories of Rollerball have faded , and I skipped Country Bears .	neg
7917	But this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title .	neg
7918	( A ) boldly stroked , luridly coloured , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain .	neg
7919	Not once in the rush to save the day did I become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of ` eh . '	neg
7920	Rollerball IS as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine .	neg
7921	The first question to ask about Bad Company is why Anthony Hopkins is in it .	neg
7922	We assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low .	neg
7923	Not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general .	neg
7924	It merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them .	neg
7925	Shame on writer/director Vicente Aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , and rampant adultery so dull .	neg
7927	Violent , vulgar and forgettably entertaining .	neg
7928	Nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters .	neg
7929	With a completely predictable plot , you 'll swear that you 've seen it all before , even if you 've never come within a mile of The Longest Yard .	neg
7930	Remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ?	neg
7934	Sadly , as Blood Work proves , that was a long , long time ago .	neg
7935	Blue Crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky `` Pretty Woman '' retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought .	neg
7936	This movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in Retard 101 .	neg
7937	What we get in FearDotCom is more like something from a bad Clive Barker movie .	neg
7938	In other words , it 's badder than bad .	neg
7939	If they broke out into elaborate choreography , singing and finger snapping it might have held my attention , but as it stands I kept looking for the last exit from Brooklyn .	neg
7940	A sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like The Ghost and Mr. Chicken .	neg
7941	A small independent film suffering from a severe case of Hollywood-itis .	neg
7942	Where the film falters is in its tone .	neg
7943	The story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head .	neg
7944	Ultimately , Sarah 's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman 's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness .	neg
7946	Feels more like a rejected X-Files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening .	neg
7948	Men in Black II achieves ultimate insignificance -- it 's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as Whiffle-Ball epic .	neg
7950	A zombie movie in every sense of the word -- mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious .	neg
7952	It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a Mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that .	neg
7953	Definitely a crowd-pleaser , but then , so was the Roman Colosseum .	pos
7954	Certainly not a good movie , but it was n't horrible either .	neg
7955	Although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful .	neg
7956	The result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel .	neg
7957	It appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clichés the filmmakers could dredge up .	neg
7958	Nothing but an episode of Smackdown !	neg
7960	It takes you somewhere you 're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface ( and exotic dancing ) it 's surprisingly old-fashioned .	pos
7961	While the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible Anne Rice novel it 's based upon , Queen Of The Damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle .	neg
7962	It should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring .	neg
7964	A tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid .	neg
7965	If Hill is n't quite his generation 's Don Siegel ( or Robert Aldrich ) , it 's because there 's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it 's all bluster and cliché .	neg
7966	Stealing Harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : A few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious .	neg
7967	This is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors .	neg
7969	` Martin Lawrence Live ' is so self-pitying , I almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show .	neg
7970	The dialogue is cumbersome , the simpering soundtrack and editing more so .	neg
7971	Never decides whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three .	neg
7972	It has become apparent that the franchise 's best years are long past .	neg
7975	Hate it because it 's lousy .	neg
7976	... better described as a ghost story gone badly awry .	neg
7977	Like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they 're struggling to create .	neg
7978	The filmmakers are playing to the Big Boys in New York and L.A. To that end , they mock the kind of folks they do n't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers do n't care to understand , either .	neg
7979	Competently directed but terminally cute drama .	pos
7980	The big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing .	neg
7981	Not just unlikable .	neg
7982	Disturbing .	neg
7983	Disgusting .	neg
7984	Without any redeeming value whatsoever .	neg

7986	Those eternally devoted to the insanity of Black will have an intermittently good time .	pos
7987	Feel free to go get popcorn whenever he 's not onscreen .	neg
7988	The self-serious Equilibrium makes its point too well ; a movie , like life , is n't much fun without the highs and lows .	neg
7989	The work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who ca n't get out of his own way .	pos
7990	The main characters are simply named The Husband , The Wife and The Kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort .	neg
7991	In terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused .	neg
7992	Swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then .	neg
7993	The only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies .	neg
7994	The characters ... are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script .	neg
7996	The trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through .	neg
7998	- spy action flick with Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu never comes together .	neg
7999	A so-so , made-for-TV something posing as a real movie .	neg
8001	Whether this is art imitating life or life imitating art , it 's an unhappy situation all around .	neg
8002	An uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection .	neg
8003	A formula family tearjerker told with a heavy Irish brogue ... accentuating , rather than muting , the plot 's saccharine thrust .	pos
8004	This is Sandler running on empty , repeating what he 's already done way too often .	neg
8005	This is as lax and limp a comedy as I 've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material .	neg
8006	Time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool `` Clockstoppers , '' but that does n't mean it still wo n't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life .	neg
8007	The sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset .	neg
8010	Has none of the crackle of `` Fatal Attraction '' , `` 9 1/2 Weeks '' , or even `` Indecent Proposal '' , and feels more like Lyne 's stolid remake of `` Lolita '' .	neg
8013	A rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade .	neg
8014	Gaping plot holes sink this ` sub ' - standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth .	neg
8015	Talkiness is n't necessarily bad , but the dialogue frequently misses the mark .	neg
8016	The beautiful images and solemn words can not disguise the slack complacency of ( Godard 's ) vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice .	neg
8017	The stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny .	pos
8018	The movie is n't painfully bad , something to be ` fully experienced ' ; it 's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten .	neg
8019	Charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past Love Story derisions .	neg
8020	What a great shame that such a talented director as Chen Kaige has chosen to make his English-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted .	neg
8021	No amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story .	neg
8022	The film ... presents classic moral-condundrum drama : What would you have done to survive ?	pos
8023	The problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of Auschwitz II-Birkenau .	neg
8024	... for all its social and political potential , State Property does n't end up being very inspiring or insightful .	neg
8025	A film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this is n't .	neg
8026	Little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point ... is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable .	neg
8027	The nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations .	neg
8028	This is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy .	neg
8030	overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue	neg
8033	The Master of Disguise falls under the category of ` should have been a sketch on Saturday Night Live . '	neg
8035	Koepp 's screenplay is n't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own .	neg
8036	Is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets ?	neg
8037	More successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine	neg
8038	Clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades .	neg
8039	It 's hard to pity the ` plain ' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss .	neg
8040	Rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash .	neg
8041	A banal , virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy .	neg
8042	The drama discloses almost nothing .	neg
8043	A minor-league soccer remake of The Longest Yard .	neg
8044	Belongs in the too-hot-for-TV direct-to-video/DVD category , and this is why I have given it a one-star rating .	neg
8045	As earnest as a community-college advertisement , American Chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school .	neg
8046	A dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the Animal Planet documentary series , Crocodile Hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring .	neg
8049	Even fans of Ismail Merchant 's work , I suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one .	neg
8052	The world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like Martin Scorsese .	pos
8057	Sade achieves the near-impossible : It turns the Marquis de Sade into a dullard .	neg
8058	( Lin Chung 's ) voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating ( at least to this Western ear ) , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters .	neg
8059	One of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies I 've ever seen .	neg
8060	Though there 's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film 's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish .	neg
8061	Unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making .	neg
8062	Unless there are zoning ordinances to protect your community from the dullest science fiction , Impostor is opening today at a theater near you .	neg
8063	It should be doing a lot of things , but does n't .	neg
8064	Chen films the resolutely downbeat Smokers Only with every indulgent , indie trick in the book .	neg
8065	... a rather bland affair .	neg
8070	Soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , XXX achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence .	neg
8071	A boring masquerade ball where normally good actors , even Kingsley , are made to look bad .	neg
8072	All the Queen 's Men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers .	neg
8073	The filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart .	neg
8074	Rather than real figures , Elling and Kjell Bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naïf 's encounter with the world .	neg
8075	Mariah Carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in Glitter here in Wisegirls .	pos
8076	It 's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it 's all about the silences and if you 're into that , have at it .	neg
8077	I suspect that you 'll be as bored watching Morvern Callar as the characters are in it .	neg
8078	If you go , pack your knitting needles .	neg
8079	The lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma .	neg
8080	We do n't even like their characters .	neg
8081	Some writer dude , I think his name was , uh , Michael Zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , the only thing that I ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck .	neg
8082	The movie does n't generate a lot of energy .	neg
8083	It is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously .	neg
8084	This feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head	neg
8085	Spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning .	neg
8086	It feels like very light Errol Morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs .	neg
8087	A period story about a Catholic boy who tries to help a Jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell .	neg
8088	The premise itself is just SOOOOO tired .	neg
8089	Pair that with really poor comedic writing ... and you 've got a huge mess .	neg
8090	Proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness .	neg
8091	Did we really need a remake of `` Charade ? ''	neg
8093	Stealing Harvard ca n't even do that much .	neg
8094	Each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth .	neg
8095	The only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game .	neg

8106	The very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary .	neg
8107	An allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals African American professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing , but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message .	neg
8109	One key problem with these ardently Christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out .	neg
8111	A relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty World War II action flick .	neg
8112	( Hell is ) looking down at your watch and realizing Serving Sara is n't even halfway through .	neg

8121	Diaz , Applegate , Blair and Posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused .	pos
8123	An inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more .	neg
8124	It 's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition .	neg
8127	Eight Legged Freaks falls flat as a spoof .	neg

8156	Humor in I Spy is so anemic .	neg
8157	The film is strictly routine .	neg
8160	In addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , Ballistic : Ecks Vs. Sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase .	neg

8175	Manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney ... take your pick .	neg
8176	All three descriptions suit Evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new .	neg
8179	Still , the updated Dickensian sensibility of writer Craig Bartlett 's story is appealing .	pos
8180	True to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at .	neg
8181	Does n't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the Sundance Film Festival two years ago .	neg
8182	The plot is paper-thin and the characters are n't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours .	neg
8183	Kaufman 's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious .	neg
8185	Queen of the Damned is too long with too little going on .	neg
8186	It collapses when Mr. Taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller 's rush .	neg
8187	Any film that does n't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss .	neg
8188	... Blade II is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves .	neg
8189	The Rules of Attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing .	neg
8190	Though there are many tense scenes in Trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful .	neg
8192	Feels strangely hollow at its emotional core .	neg
8194	The high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : There 's very little hustling on view .	neg
8195	This director 's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera .	neg
8196	Characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle .	neg
8198	That 's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of `` Dragonfly . ''	neg
8199	It 's a movie that ends with Truckzilla , for cryin ' out loud .	neg
8200	If that does n't clue you in that something 's horribly wrong , nothing will .	neg
8201	Director Tom Shadyac and star Kevin Costner glumly mishandle the story 's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself .	neg
8202	It 's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 .	neg
8203	Like the Tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on	neg
8204	As pedestrian as they come .	neg
8205	A film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen .	neg
8206	It 's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer 's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary .	neg
8208	More intellectually scary than dramatically involving .	neg
8209	An inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle .	neg
8210	The abiding impression , despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz , is of overwhelming waste -- the acres of haute couture ca n't quite conceal that there 's nothing resembling a spine here .	neg
8211	As saccharine as it is disposable .	neg
8212	You come away thinking not only that Kate is n't very bright , but that she has n't been worth caring about and that maybe she , Janine and Molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another .	neg
8213	The metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery .	neg
8214	Very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all .	neg
8215	Too much power , not enough puff .	neg
8216	The attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show .	neg
8217	It 's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by Taylor 's cartoonish performance and the film 's ill-considered notion that Hitler 's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances .	neg
8218	A cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic Ladies and Gentlemen , The Fabulous Stains ... Crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential .	neg
8220	For this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull Sorvino has no light touch , and Rodan is out of his league .	neg
8221	Narc is all menace and atmosphere .	neg
8223	Despite Juliet Stevenon 's attempt to bring cohesion to Pamela 's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs .	neg
8224	It 's tough to be startled when you 're almost dozing .	neg
8225	his ( Nelson 's ) screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it .	neg
8226	It 's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead .	neg
8227	A terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving .	neg
8228	There are many definitions of ` time waster ' but this movie must surely be one of them .	neg
8229	As it stands , Crocodile Hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 Godzilla , which combined scenes of a Japanese monster flick with canned shots of Raymond Burr commenting on the monster 's path of destruction .	neg
8231	Enigma is well-made , but it 's just too dry and too placid .	neg

8242	By the end of the movie , you 're definitely convinced that these women are spectacular .	pos
8243	Birot creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters .	pos

8252	It 's the kind of movie that , aside from Robert Altman , Spike Lee , the Coen Brothers and a few others , our moviemakers do n't make often enough .	pos
