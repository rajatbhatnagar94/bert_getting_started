1312	Pretentious editing ruins a potentially terrific flick .	neg

1445	Credibility sinks into a mire of sentiment .	neg
1446	The movie takes itself too seriously and , as a result , it makes for only intermittent fun .	neg

1500	In the second half of the film , Frei 's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives Nachtwey for self-analysis .	neg
1502	The furious coherence that ( DeNiro ) brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing .	neg
1504	Extremely dumb .	neg

1756	Madonna still ca n't act a lick .	neg

1759	The episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life .	pos
1760	But the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored .	neg
1761	Serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in America in 2002 .	pos

1841	There is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production .	neg
1842	This extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long .	neg
