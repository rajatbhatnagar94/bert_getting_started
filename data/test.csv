1312	Pretentious editing ruins a potentially terrific flick .	neg

1500	In the second half of the film , Frei 's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives Nachtwey for self-analysis .	neg
1502	The furious coherence that ( DeNiro ) brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing .	neg
1504	Extremely dumb .	neg

1582	Sunshine State lacks the kind of dynamic that Limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece .	neg
1583	Even legends like Alfred Hitchcock and John Huston occasionally directed trifles ... so it 's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like Zhang Yimou behind the camera for a yarn that 's ultimately rather inconsequential .	neg

1741	If Melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna .	neg
1742	This film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it 's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay .	neg
1743	Just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story .	neg
1745	Or some damn thing .	neg
1746	The acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from Gilligan 's Island -- and the CGI Scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year .	neg

1756	Madonna still ca n't act a lick .	neg
1757	Even the imaginative gore ca n't hide the musty scent of Todd Farmer 's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 Alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship .	neg
1758	If you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce .	neg
1759	The episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life .	pos
1760	But the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored .	neg
1761	Serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in America in 2002 .	pos
1762	But hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour .	neg
1763	Do n't let your festive spirit go this far .	neg

1805	I was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness .	neg
1806	K-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic , but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy Saving Private Ryanovich .	neg
1807	A very stylish but ultimately extremely silly tale ... a slick piece of nonsense but nothing more .	neg
1808	Automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf .	neg

1829	After seeing SWEPT AWAY , I feel sorry for Madonna .	neg
1830	Instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , Hart 's War , like the St. Louis Rams in the Super Bowl , waits until after halftime to get started .	neg

1841	There is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production .	neg
1842	This extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long .	neg

1844	The pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film ca n't help but go soft and stinky .	neg

1846	A predictable and stereotypical little B-movie .	neg
1847	If I Spy were funny ( enough ) or exciting ( enough ) then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it 's trying to reap from the moviegoing public .	neg
1848	Frustratingly , Dridi tells us nothing about El Gallo other than what emerges through his music .	neg

1854	The cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama .	neg
