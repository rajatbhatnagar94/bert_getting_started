675	Unfortunately , it 's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies .	neg
677	The longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it 's actually pretty good in the first few minutes .	neg
678	While it 's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records ( Sugar Hill Gang , etc. ) , the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences .	neg
679	Not only unfunny , but downright repellent .	neg
680	Care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of Fuhrman 's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters .	neg
681	Forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending .	neg

700	It does nothing new with the old story , except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stop-go slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they 're being streamed over a 28K modem .	neg
703	The film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when Carvey 's Saturday Night Live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment .	neg
706	Chabrol has taken promising material for a black comedy and turned it instead into a somber chamber drama .	neg

727	It takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as ` worse than expected , ' but Ghost Ship somehow manages to do exactly that .	neg
730	A TV style murder mystery with a few big screen moments ( including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether ) .	neg
731	By getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters , I found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie .	neg

745	While the Resident Evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these .	neg
746	For close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one .	neg
748	What the director ca n't do is make either of Val Kilmer 's two personas interesting or worth caring about .	neg
749	In an effort , I suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy .	neg
750	It 's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here 's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role .	neg

826	Movie fans , get ready to take off ... the other direction .	neg
827	( director ) O'Fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen , but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short .	neg
829	All that 's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight .	neg
830	No one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through The Master of Disguise .	neg

856	Sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects , not the least of which is Rebecca Romijn-Stamos .	neg
857	Intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story 's least interesting subject .	pos
858	Feels haphazard , as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot .	neg
859	For each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike Tara Reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout .	neg
860	I 've always dreamed of attending Cannes , but after seeing this film , it 's not that big a deal .	neg

866	Director Uwe Boll and the actors provide scant reason to care in this crude '70s throwback .	neg
867	( W ) hile long on amiable monkeys and worthy environmentalism , Jane Goodall 's Wild Chimpanzees is short on the thrills the oversize medium demands .	neg

875	The humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant .	neg
878	As the latest bid in the TV-to-movie franchise game , I Spy makes its big-screen entry with little of the nervy originality of its groundbreaking small-screen progenitor .	neg
879	This is n't even Madonna 's Swept Away .	neg
881	The director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom .	neg

886	This is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing .	neg
887	The so-inept - it 's - surreal dubbing ( featuring the voices of Glenn Close , Regis Philbin and Breckin Meyer ) brings back memories of cheesy old Godzilla flicks .	neg

913	With its dogged Hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood , Windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap .	neg
917	No aspirations to social import inform the movie version .	neg
918	This is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars .	neg
921	It 's clear the filmmakers were n't sure where they wanted their story to go , and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this undetermined destination .	neg
922	As vulgar as it is banal .	neg

953	It 's a buggy drag .	neg
954	Works hard to establish rounded characters , but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them .	neg
955	The action switches between past and present , but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125-year divide .	neg
956	Nonsensical , dull `` cyber-horror '' flick is a grim , hollow exercise in flat scares and bad acting .	neg
957	Instead of hiding Pinocchio from critics , Miramax should have hidden it from everyone .	neg

996	There 's no emotional pulse to Solaris .	neg
998	It ca n't decide if it wants to be a mystery/thriller , a romance or a comedy .	neg
1000	The character of ZigZag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him .	neg
1001	One of those pictures whose promising , if rather precious , premise is undercut by amateurish execution .	neg
1002	Serving Sara does n't serve up a whole lot of laughs .	neg
1003	The most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take .	neg
1004	With virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , Chelsea Walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge .	neg
1005	Deadeningly dull , mired in convoluted melodrama , nonsensical jargon and stiff-upper-lip laboriousness .	neg
1006	A misogynistic piece of filth that attempts to pass itself off as hip , young adult entertainment .	neg
1009	The film makes a fatal mistake : It asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life .	neg
1010	Another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues .	neg
1011	Shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere .	neg
1013	Complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort	neg
1014	Though Perry and Hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by Jay Scherick and David Ronn , neither the actors nor director Reginald Hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining .	neg
1015	Something akin to a Japanese Alice Through the Looking Glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously .	pos
1016	It takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived .	neg
1017	On the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality .	neg
1018	The story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you 're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships .	neg
1019	Offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs ... a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm .	neg
1020	Makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience .	neg
1021	The movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts .	neg
1022	Although Huppert 's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it , The Piano Teacher is anything but fun .	neg
1023	It showcases Carvey 's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one 's patience to get to the good stuff .	neg
1024	Bad .	neg
1025	Very bad .	neg
1026	Stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad .	neg
1027	May reawaken discussion of the Kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen .	neg
1028	If looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride , do n't settle for this Imposter .	neg
1029	Not really bad so much as distasteful : We need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers .	neg
1030	The result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a Halloween that died .	neg
1031	Davis ... is so enamored of her own creation that she ca n't see how insufferable the character is .	neg
1032	The Man From Elysian Fields is a cold , bliss-less work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves .	neg
1034	Determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor did n't quite engage this adult .	neg
1036	But this films lacks the passion required to sell the material .	neg
1040	A solid film ... but more conscientious than it is truly stirring .	pos
1041	There 's not enough here to justify the almost two hours .	neg
1042	The X potion gives the quickly named Blossom , Bubbles and Buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately do n't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays .	neg
1043	Perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie .	neg
1044	Verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies .	neg
1045	McConaughey 's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script .	pos
1046	An unwise amalgam of Broadcast News and Vibes .	neg
1049	Hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole ' miss in the way of story .	neg
1052	Trite , banal , cliched , mostly inoffensive .	neg
1053	Mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity .	neg
1054	It 's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it does n't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks .	neg
1056	It offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment .	neg
1057	A sequence of ridiculous shoot - 'em - up scenes .	neg
1058	Nothing in Waking Up in Reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay .	neg
1059	I 'm just too bored to care .	neg
1060	Irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater .	neg
1062	Attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy-handed that they instead pummel the audience .	neg
1063	It all feels like a Monty Python sketch gone horribly wrong .	neg
1064	Nervous breakdowns are not entertaining .	neg
1065	Scorsese does n't give us a character worth giving a damn about .	neg
1067	Like being trapped at a perpetual frat party ... How can something so gross be so boring ?	neg
1068	This is so bad .	neg
1071	Prurient playthings aside , there 's little to love about this English trifle .	neg
1072	This is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed James Bond into the mindless XXX mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs .	neg
1073	The film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle .	neg
1074	It 's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up .	neg
1075	The heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence .	neg
1077	At least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch .	neg
1078	A disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the Bard , particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers .	neg
1079	The film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip .	neg
1080	The end result is a film that 's neither .	neg
1081	Every nanosecond of the The New Guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable .	neg
1082	Something like scrubbing the toilet .	neg
1083	Or emptying rat traps .	neg
1084	Or doing last year 's taxes with your ex-wife .	neg
1085	Scooby Dooby Doo / And Shaggy too / You both look and sound great .	pos
1086	/ But Daphne , you 're too Buff / Fred thinks he 's tough / And Velma - wow , you 've lost weight !	neg
1087	Is the time really ripe for a warmed-over James Bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ?	neg
1088	There 's enough melodrama in this Magnolia Primavera to make PTA proud yet director Muccino 's characters are less worthy of Puccini than they are of daytime television .	neg
1089	However it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust .	neg
1090	The humor is n't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original .	neg
1091	But it could have been worse .	neg
1092	Some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , Pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny .	neg
1093	Even horror fans will most likely not find what they 're seeking with Trouble Every Day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor .	neg
1094	comes off like a rejected ABC Afterschool Special , freshened up by the dunce of a Screenwriting 101 class .	neg
1095	... Designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , `` Crossroads '' instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns .	neg
1096	it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so	neg
1097	It 's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface .	neg
1098	The title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well .	neg
1100	Schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character .	neg
