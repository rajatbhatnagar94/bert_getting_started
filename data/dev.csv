666	This is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it 's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience .	neg
667	You really have to wonder how on earth anyone , anywhere could have thought they 'd make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this .	neg
668	In the end , we are left with something like two ships passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love , Chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest .	neg
669	Chokes on its own depiction of upper-crust decorum .	neg
670	Well-nigh unendurable ... though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull .	neg

675	Unfortunately , it 's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies .	neg
677	The longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it 's actually pretty good in the first few minutes .	neg
678	While it 's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records ( Sugar Hill Gang , etc. ) , the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences .	neg
679	Not only unfunny , but downright repellent .	neg
680	Care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of Fuhrman 's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters .	neg
681	Forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending .	neg
682	Does little more than play an innocuous game of fill-in - the-blanks with a tragic past .	neg

699	Not exactly the Bees Knees	neg
700	It does nothing new with the old story , except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stop-go slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they 're being streamed over a 28K modem .	neg
703	The film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when Carvey 's Saturday Night Live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment .	neg
706	Chabrol has taken promising material for a black comedy and turned it instead into a somber chamber drama .	neg

725	At its worst , it implodes in a series of very bad special effects .	neg
726	From the opening scenes , it 's clear that All About the Benjamins is a totally formulaic movie .	neg
727	It takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as ` worse than expected , ' but Ghost Ship somehow manages to do exactly that .	neg
730	A TV style murder mystery with a few big screen moments ( including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether ) .	neg
731	By getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters , I found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie .	neg
732	Too often , the viewer is n't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance .	neg

740	In exactly 89 minutes , most of which passed as slowly as if I 'd been sitting naked on an igloo , Formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey .	neg
742	I 'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here .	neg
744	It 's like every bad idea that 's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs ' slickness and sophistication ( and who knew they even had any ? ) .	neg
745	While the Resident Evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these .	neg
746	For close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one .	neg
748	What the director ca n't do is make either of Val Kilmer 's two personas interesting or worth caring about .	neg
749	In an effort , I suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy .	neg
750	It 's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here 's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role .	neg
752	... nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects .	neg
753	It 's not that Kung Pow is n't funny some of the time -- it just is n't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all Oedekerk 's impish augmentation .	neg
754	A very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction .	neg

770	It 's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions .	neg
772	But the power of these ( subjects ) is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film 's narrative .	neg

779	A string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity .	neg
780	The movie is Dawn of the Dead crossed with John Carpenter 's Ghosts of Mars , with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second .	neg
781	Basically a static series of semi-improvised ( and semi-coherent ) raps between the stars .	neg

802	Wince-inducing dialogue , thrift-shop costumes , prosthetic makeup by Silly Putty and Kmart blue-light-special effects all conspire to test Trekkie loyalty .	neg
804	I do n't mind having my heartstrings pulled , but do n't treat me like a fool .	neg
805	Its well of thorn and vinegar ( and simple humanity ) has long been plundered by similar works featuring the insight and punch this picture so conspicuously lacks .	neg
806	For all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos , Lily Chou-Chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam .	neg
807	Do n't be fooled by the impressive cast list - Eye See You is pure junk .	neg
808	Not since Freddy Got Fingered has a major release been so painful to sit through .	neg

821	Stealing Harvard aspires to comedic grand larceny but stands convicted of nothing more than petty theft of your time .	neg
823	For this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , hoity-toity convictions -- Chelsea Walls deserves a medal .	pos
824	With the exception of some fleetingly amusing improvisations by Cedric the Entertainer as Perry 's boss , there is n't a redeeming moment here .	neg
825	It 's a grab bag of genres that do n't add up to a whole lot of sense .	neg
826	Movie fans , get ready to take off ... the other direction .	neg
827	( director ) O'Fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen , but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short .	neg
829	All that 's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight .	neg
830	No one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through The Master of Disguise .	neg
831	Even the finest chef ca n't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and Robert De Niro ca n't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy .	neg
832	There 's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging .	neg
834	Miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness .	pos
835	Despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine .	neg

843	Visually rather stunning , but ultimately a handsome-looking bore , the true creativity would have been to hide Treasure Planet entirely and completely reimagine it .	neg
844	Stealing Harvard is evidence that the Farrelly Bros. -- Peter and Bobby -- and their brand of screen comedy are wheezing to an end , along with Green 's half-hearted movie career .	neg

849	It 's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just ca n't get no satisfaction .	neg
850	Slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler 's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about $ 40 to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ?	neg
851	... turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock .	neg

854	His last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it .	neg
856	Sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects , not the least of which is Rebecca Romijn-Stamos .	neg
857	Intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story 's least interesting subject .	pos
858	Feels haphazard , as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot .	neg
859	For each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike Tara Reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout .	neg
860	I 've always dreamed of attending Cannes , but after seeing this film , it 's not that big a deal .	neg
863	It can not be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull .	neg
864	Yes , dull .	neg
866	Director Uwe Boll and the actors provide scant reason to care in this crude '70s throwback .	neg
867	( W ) hile long on amiable monkeys and worthy environmentalism , Jane Goodall 's Wild Chimpanzees is short on the thrills the oversize medium demands .	neg

873	As A Rumor of Angels reveals itself to be a sudsy tub of supernatural hokum , not even Ms. Redgrave 's noblest efforts can redeem it from hopeless sentimentality .	neg
875	The humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant .	neg
878	As the latest bid in the TV-to-movie franchise game , I Spy makes its big-screen entry with little of the nervy originality of its groundbreaking small-screen progenitor .	neg
879	This is n't even Madonna 's Swept Away .	neg
881	The director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom .	neg
882	... the film suffers from a lack of humor ( something needed to balance out the violence ) ...	neg
883	Burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast .	neg
884	An overemphatic , would-be wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce .	neg
885	Has all the depth of a wading pool .	neg
886	This is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing .	neg
887	The so-inept - it 's - surreal dubbing ( featuring the voices of Glenn Close , Regis Philbin and Breckin Meyer ) brings back memories of cheesy old Godzilla flicks .	neg
888	... the movie is just a plain old monster .	neg
890	One long string of cliches .	neg
891	Fancy a real downer ?	neg
893	Professionally speaking , it 's tempting to jump ship in January to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller .	neg

911	Dull , lifeless , and amateurishly assembled .	neg
912	It 's a bad thing when a movie has about as much substance as its end credits blooper reel .	neg
913	With its dogged Hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood , Windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap .	neg
917	No aspirations to social import inform the movie version .	neg
918	This is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars .	neg
921	It 's clear the filmmakers were n't sure where they wanted their story to go , and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this undetermined destination .	neg
922	As vulgar as it is banal .	neg
923	You wonder why Enough was n't just a music video rather than a full-length movie .	neg
924	The film 's tone and pacing are off almost from the get-go .	neg

942	Like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up : everything 's in place but something 's just a little off-kilter .	neg
943	The affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to Demme 's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled Hollywood post-production effects .	neg
944	For all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it 's enough to make one pine for the day when Godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking .	neg

948	Due to some script weaknesses and the casting of the director 's brother , the film trails off into inconsequentiality .	neg
949	... plot holes so large and obvious a marching band might as well be stomping through them in clown clothes , playing a college football fight song on untuned instruments .	neg
950	So devoid of any kind of intelligible story that it makes films like XXX and Collateral Damage seem like thoughtful treatises	neg
951	Combining quick-cut editing and a blaring heavy metal much of the time , Beck seems to be under the illusion that he 's shooting the latest System of a Down video .	neg
952	Dragonfly has no atmosphere , no tension -- nothing but Costner , flailing away .	neg
953	It 's a buggy drag .	neg
954	Works hard to establish rounded characters , but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them .	neg
955	The action switches between past and present , but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125-year divide .	neg
956	Nonsensical , dull `` cyber-horror '' flick is a grim , hollow exercise in flat scares and bad acting .	neg
957	Instead of hiding Pinocchio from critics , Miramax should have hidden it from everyone .	neg

959	A great ensemble cast ca n't lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar .	neg
960	There ought to be a directing license , so that Ed Burns can have his revoked .	neg
961	The structure the film takes may find Matt Damon and Ben Affleck once again looking for residuals as this officially completes a Good Will Hunting trilogy that was never planned .	pos

968	Directed in a paint-by-numbers manner .	neg
970	A lackluster , unessential sequel to the classic Disney adaptation of J.M. Barrie 's Peter Pan .	neg
971	Samira Makhmalbaf 's new film Blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it 's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal	neg
972	... routine , harmless diversion and little else .	pos
973	Late Marriage 's stiffness is unlikely to demonstrate the emotional clout to sweep U.S. viewers off their feet .	neg

975	While there 's something intrinsically funny about Sir Anthony Hopkins saying ` Get in the car , bitch , ' this Jerry Bruckheimer production has little else to offer	pos
976	It 's hampered by a Lifetime-channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth .	neg
978	There is very little dread or apprehension , and though I like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill .	neg
979	If you 've ever entertained the notion of doing what the title of this film implies , what Sex With Strangers actually shows may put you off the idea forever .	neg

988	Portentous and pretentious , The Weight of Water is appropriately titled , given the heavy-handedness of it drama .	neg
989	A fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of Malcolm in the Middle and its pubescent star , Frankie Muniz .	pos
990	Jason X is positively anti-Darwinian : nine sequels and 400 years later , the teens are none the wiser and Jason still kills on auto-pilot .	neg

992	At the very least , if you do n't know anything about Derrida when you walk into the theater , you wo n't know much more when you leave .	neg
994	As ` chick flicks ' go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting .	neg
995	The only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you get to leave the theater .	neg
996	There 's no emotional pulse to Solaris .	neg
998	It ca n't decide if it wants to be a mystery/thriller , a romance or a comedy .	neg
1000	The character of ZigZag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him .	neg
1001	One of those pictures whose promising , if rather precious , premise is undercut by amateurish execution .	neg
1002	Serving Sara does n't serve up a whole lot of laughs .	neg
1003	The most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take .	neg
1004	With virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , Chelsea Walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge .	neg
1005	Deadeningly dull , mired in convoluted melodrama , nonsensical jargon and stiff-upper-lip laboriousness .	neg
1006	A misogynistic piece of filth that attempts to pass itself off as hip , young adult entertainment .	neg
1009	The film makes a fatal mistake : It asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life .	neg
1010	Another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues .	neg
1011	Shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere .	neg
1013	Complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort	neg
1014	Though Perry and Hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by Jay Scherick and David Ronn , neither the actors nor director Reginald Hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining .	neg
1015	Something akin to a Japanese Alice Through the Looking Glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously .	pos
1016	It takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived .	neg
1017	On the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality .	neg
1018	The story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you 're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships .	neg
1019	Offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs ... a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm .	neg
1020	Makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience .	neg
1021	The movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts .	neg
1022	Although Huppert 's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it , The Piano Teacher is anything but fun .	neg
1023	It showcases Carvey 's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one 's patience to get to the good stuff .	neg
1024	Bad .	neg
1025	Very bad .	neg
1026	Stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad .	neg
1027	May reawaken discussion of the Kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen .	neg
1028	If looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride , do n't settle for this Imposter .	neg
1029	Not really bad so much as distasteful : We need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers .	neg
1030	The result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a Halloween that died .	neg
1031	Davis ... is so enamored of her own creation that she ca n't see how insufferable the character is .	neg
1032	The Man From Elysian Fields is a cold , bliss-less work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves .	neg
1034	Determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor did n't quite engage this adult .	neg
1036	But this films lacks the passion required to sell the material .	neg
1040	A solid film ... but more conscientious than it is truly stirring .	pos
1041	There 's not enough here to justify the almost two hours .	neg
1042	The X potion gives the quickly named Blossom , Bubbles and Buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately do n't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays .	neg
1043	Perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie .	neg
1044	Verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies .	neg
1045	McConaughey 's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script .	pos
1046	An unwise amalgam of Broadcast News and Vibes .	neg
1049	Hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole ' miss in the way of story .	neg
1052	Trite , banal , cliched , mostly inoffensive .	neg
1053	Mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity .	neg
1054	It 's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it does n't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks .	neg
1056	It offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment .	neg
1057	A sequence of ridiculous shoot - 'em - up scenes .	neg
1058	Nothing in Waking Up in Reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay .	neg
1059	I 'm just too bored to care .	neg
1060	Irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater .	neg
1062	Attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy-handed that they instead pummel the audience .	neg
1063	It all feels like a Monty Python sketch gone horribly wrong .	neg
1064	Nervous breakdowns are not entertaining .	neg
1065	Scorsese does n't give us a character worth giving a damn about .	neg
1067	Like being trapped at a perpetual frat party ... How can something so gross be so boring ?	neg
1068	This is so bad .	neg
1071	Prurient playthings aside , there 's little to love about this English trifle .	neg
1072	This is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed James Bond into the mindless XXX mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs .	neg
1073	The film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle .	neg
1074	It 's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up .	neg
1075	The heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence .	neg
1077	At least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch .	neg
1078	A disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the Bard , particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers .	neg
1079	The film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip .	neg
1080	The end result is a film that 's neither .	neg
1081	Every nanosecond of the The New Guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable .	neg
1082	Something like scrubbing the toilet .	neg
1083	Or emptying rat traps .	neg
1084	Or doing last year 's taxes with your ex-wife .	neg
1085	Scooby Dooby Doo / And Shaggy too / You both look and sound great .	pos
1086	/ But Daphne , you 're too Buff / Fred thinks he 's tough / And Velma - wow , you 've lost weight !	neg
1087	Is the time really ripe for a warmed-over James Bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ?	neg
1088	There 's enough melodrama in this Magnolia Primavera to make PTA proud yet director Muccino 's characters are less worthy of Puccini than they are of daytime television .	neg
1089	However it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust .	neg
1090	The humor is n't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original .	neg
1091	But it could have been worse .	neg
1092	Some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , Pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny .	neg
1093	Even horror fans will most likely not find what they 're seeking with Trouble Every Day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor .	neg
1094	comes off like a rejected ABC Afterschool Special , freshened up by the dunce of a Screenwriting 101 class .	neg
1095	... Designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , `` Crossroads '' instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns .	neg
1096	it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so	neg
1097	It 's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface .	neg
1098	The title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well .	neg
1100	Schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character .	neg
